# StepPositionIcon



## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| active | boolean |  | Whether this step is active. |
| classes | Object |  | Classses for component style customizations. |
| position | Icon |  | The step position as a number. |

Any other properties supplied will be [spread to the root element](/customization/api#spread).

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `text`
- `active`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes) section
and the [implementation of the component](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/src/Stepper/StepPositionIcon.js)
for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `undefined`.
