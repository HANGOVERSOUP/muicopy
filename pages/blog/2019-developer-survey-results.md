# 2019 Material-UI Developer Survey results

**Olivier Tassinari**

_March 16, 2019_

While we are currently working on the upcoming release of Material-UI v4, we need to prioritize our 
roadmap for the coming year. To refine our focus, we launched a developer survey last month, 
to which we received 734 contributions. Thank you for your participation! 
The survey is now closed and this is a summary of the results.

The survey was broken into three sections, "Introduction", "About you" and "Your product".

## Introduction

Here we asked for the good, the bad and the ugly. Thankfully, it's mostly good, but we can focus
on the things that will make it even better.

### 1. How would you feel if you could no longer use Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/1.png" alt="Pie chart: 74.7% Very disappointed, 18.9% disappointed, 6.4% not disappointed." />

An overwhelming majority of respondents (over 93%), would be disappointed or very disappointed if 
they could no longer use Material-UI. The benchmark for "very disappointed" is 40%, 
so we're on the right track. Don't worry, Material-UI isn't going away any time soon ‚Äì 
we want to focus on making even more of you "very disappointed", as it were!

Curiously, the 6.4% who said they would _not_ be disappointed if they could no longer use 
Material-UI collectively gave a Net Promoter Score of 68%, which is 
[higher than that of all respondents as a whole](/blog/2019-developer-survey-results#5-how-likely-is-it-that-you-would-recommend-material-ui-to-a-friend-or-colleague),
so we know they love us really. üòò

### 2. Who do you think would most benefit from Material-UI?

This word cloud was generated with [wordclouds.com](https://wordclouds.com).

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/2.png" alt="Word cloud of who would benefit most" />

Developers, developers, developers! (And "anyone" and "everyone", apparently! ) This is understandable, given the
[job role demographic](2019-developer-survey-results#7-which-of-the-following-best-describes-your-current-job-role)
of the majority of respondents. We'll continue to work on the developer experience, making it
easier to get started with, use, and customize Material-UI.

### 3. What is the main benefit you receive from Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/3.png" alt="Word cloud of the main benefit of Material-UI" />

The responses variously commented on being able to focus on the business logic, time saved, 
good looking components, ease of use, design consistency, good documentation. 
We'll make sure that we continue to do more of the things that benefit you the most.

### 4. How can we improve Material-UI for you?

### 5. How likely is it that you would recommend Material-UI to a friend or colleague?

  <figcaption style="font-style: italic; margin: 8px;">Raw data.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br />
<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/5b.png" alt="Pie chart: 70.6% promoters, 24.8% neutrals, 4.6% detractors" />

Developers gave Material-UI a [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) 
(promoters less detractors) of 66%. Given the NPS range of -100 to +100, a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù score or NPS 
above 0 is considered ‚Äúgood‚Äù, +50 is ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù, and above 70 is considered ‚Äúworld class.‚Äù

## About you

### 6. How did you hear about Material-UI?

Multiple options were allowed.

| Channel(s) | Number |
|-----|-----|
| Search | 344 |
| Word of mouth | 112 |
| Search, Word of mouth | 47 |
| Search, Social | 25 |
| Social | 22 |
| Blog | 14 |
| Search, Word of mouth, Blog | 11 |

<br /><br />
<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/6.png" alt="Bar chart: 74.3% search, 29.6% word of mouth, 8.2% Social, 4.3% blog." />

### 7. Which of the following best describes your current job role?

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/7.png" alt="Bar chart: 358 Full-stack developers, 189 Frontend developers, 103 Entrepreneurs, 31 Beginners, 42 Other" />

No huge surprises here!

### 8. How big is your organization?

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/8.png" alt="Bar chart: 61 Hobby, 98 Self-employed, 181 x 2-10, 167 x 11-50, 126 x 51-500, 89 x 500 +" />

Material-UI is most popular with small to medium sized organisations, 
perhaps because beyond a certain size, organizations have teams building their own design system and framework.
We want to continue to make it easy to use the component logic of Material-UI while allowing
designers to give it a bespoke look and feel for their organization.

### 9. How long have you been developing with JavaScript

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/9.png" alt="Bar chart: 26 x I'm just getting started!, 43 x 6 months +, 150 x 1 year +, 179 x 3 years +, 155 x 5 years, 82 x 10 years +, 47 x 15 years +" />

A nice bell curve, with the majority of developers having 1 to 5 years experience with Javascript.

### 10. How long have you been developing with React?

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/10.png" alt="Bar chart: 99	x I'm just getting started!, 77	x 6 months +, 301 x 1 year +, 171 x 3 years +, 32 x 5 years - bleeding edge baby!" />

### 11. How long have you been developing with Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/11.png" alt="Bar chart: 160	x I'm just getting started!, 147	x 6 months +, 293	x 1 year +, 71 x 3 years +, 11 x Four years + ‚Äì I'm a pioneer!" />

We missed a trick by not including "2 years +" here, so "1 year +" looks stacked. 
The number of users of Material-UI continues to grow at a steady pace, and once on board, many 
developers stick with it.

### 12. What were you primarily using before Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/12.png" alt="Bar chart: 55% Bootstrap, 18% Custom, 12% Other, 7% Semantic-IU, 6% Materialize, 3% React Toolbox" />

Given its relative popularity, and the move from CSS / HTML / jQuery towards front-end frameworks,
it should come as no big surprise to see that the majority of respondents were previously using Bootstrap.
Custom solutions have also been replaced by Material-UI as your go-to UI library, along with a 
long-tail of other frameworks.


### 13. How many Material-UI based projects have you built?

<img src="/static/blog/2019-survey/13.png" alt="Pie chart: 10.7% I'm just getting started, 23.5% 1, 52.5% 2-5, 11.1% 6-10, 2.2% 11+" />

## Conclusion

This data is **incredibly valuable** for our team.
Again, thank you for participating!
We want to work on the problems that resonate the most with our users.
[It's clear](#4-how-can-we-improve-material-ui-for-you) that we should:

1. Support more components
2. Improve the customization
3. Improve the documentation
4. Improve the static typings
5. Reduce the overhead of the library

**We will update [our ROADMAP](/discover-more/roadmap/) in the coming days**.
We will run a similar survey next year to keep track of our progress.
