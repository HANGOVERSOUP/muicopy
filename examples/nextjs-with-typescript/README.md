## The idea behind the example

[Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) is a framework for server-rendered React apps.

Additionally, the template project adds `@material-ui/core` and it's peer dependencies. As `@emotion` is used as a style engine in `@material-ui/core`, the necessary setup for it was done in the example project.
