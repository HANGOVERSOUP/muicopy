# Base UI - Create React App example with MUI System in TypeScript

[Base UI](https://mui.com/base/getting-started/overview/) is a library of unstyled React UI components which includes prebuilt components with production-ready functionality, along with low-level hooks for transferring that functionality to other components.

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is a framework for quickly creating a new React project without the need to configure complex build tools or development environments.

[MUI System](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/overview/) is a set of CSS utilities for building custom designs more efficiently when working with MUI component libraries.
(Note: MUI System, in turn, relies on [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).
You can uninstall `@mui/system`, `@emotion/react`, and `@emotion/styled` if you plan to use a different styling solution.)
