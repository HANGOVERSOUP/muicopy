## MUI Core

The Core is MUI's foundational product line.
It grew out of Material UI, and that library's legacy lives on in the name of the repo on GitHub: [`mui/material-ui`](https://github.com/mui/material-ui).

But this repo contains much more than just Material UI these days.
Read on to learn more about the full suite of MUI Core tools.

### Material UI

Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box.

Material UI is beautiful by design and features a suite of customization options that make it easy to implement your own custom design system on top of our components.

#### Key features

- Material Design: Your app will look and feel excellent by default, thanks to our meticulous implementation of Material Design.
- Comprehensiveness: with over 50 foundational components and counting, you've got everything you need to ship new features fast.
- Maturity: Material UI's age and maturity rival that of React itself, with its origins spanning all the way back to 2014.
- Community: Over 2,500 open-source contributors have made this library what it is today.

#### Ideal use cases

- User interfaces that adhere to Material Design
- Internal/admin tools
- Dev teams that need to ship features in hours rather than weeks

### Joy UI

Joy UI is an open-source React component library that implements MUI's own in-house design principles.
It's intended to serve as an alternative to Material UI for designs that don't adhere to Material Design specifications.

Try Joy UI if you appreciate the comprehensiveness and reliability of Material UI, but don't need all of the additional baggage that comes along with Material Design.
