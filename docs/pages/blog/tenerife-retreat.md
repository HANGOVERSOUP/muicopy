One of the toughest challenges to overcome as a fully remote team is fostering a supportive and inclusive company culture.
How do you build trust, comradery, and‚Äîdare I say it?‚Äîfriendships when there are so few opportunities for spontaneous social interactions in our daily work routines?

At MUI, we've chosen to prioritize in-person company retreats as a way to grow together and cultivate the culture that informs how we operate.

In late June 2022, sixteen of us gathered at a remote private residence on the island of Tenerife.
This was MUI's second company retreat, the first being in Portugal in 2021 when the team was just a fraction of the size it is today.

We had a ton of fun getting to know each other better over oceanic activities, poolside conversations, and incredible catered meals‚Äînot to mention a steady supply of Spanish wine. ü•Ç
Oh, and I guess we got some work done along the way, too? üòÖ

## Destination

![Satellite image of Tenerife](/static/blog/tenerife-retreat/tenerife.jpeg)

Tenerife is a volcanic island off the coast of western Africa that's part of the Canary Islands (Spanish: _Canarias_).
It is the most populous island in the archipelago, and one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world.
Its central defining feature is Mount Teide, the third largest volcano in the world when measured from its base, rising 7,500 m (24,600 ft) from the bottom of the ocean floor.

With an average temperature ranging from about 18-25 ¬∞C (68-77 ¬∞F) year-round, it's hard to pick a bad time to visit!

## Accommodations

[Symbiosis Living](https://www.symbiosisliving.com/) is a sustainable retreat venue nestled deep in the hills on the western side of the island.
The venue is a venerable oasis of lush green flora amid the stark and barren volcanic rock that surrounds it, hosting breezy guest houses adorned with rustic, regionally sourced furniture.

The owners were exceptionally accommodating and supportive for the entirety of our stay.
Almost all of our meals were cooked fresh by the hosts in their fabulous outdoor kitchen.
I don't think I've ever eaten that many incredible home-cooked meals in a single week. üòã
And somehow each one was even better than the last!

## Activities

Throughout our stay in Tenerife, we arranged group activities to make the most of what the island has to offer.

### Whale and dolphin watching

Our first full day together saw us venture out into the Atlantic Ocean in search of dolphins and whales.

The waters surrounding the Canary Islands are a biodiversity hotspot, and feeding grounds for many different species of marine mammals.
We spotted several [pilot whales](https://whalewatchtenerife.org/pilot-whales/) and what I believe were [bottlenose dolphins](https://whalewatchtenerife.org/bottlenose-dolphin/), though I'll be the first to admit that I'm no expert. üòÖ

Several of us (myself included) made a critical mistake by skipping the sunscreen because it was a cloudy day.
We got burned to a crisp!
And on the first day of the retreat, no less! üò≠
Don't be like us.
Wear sunscreen.

### Scuba diving lessons

On day two we split up into smaller groups to get individualized lessons in scuba diving at the beach in Playa San Juan.

I have to admit that I was pretty intimidated, especially after I put on all the gear and tried breathing from the tank for the first time.
But once I got into the groove, the time underwater went by so quickly!
The main highlights for me were spotting a [ray](https://aqua-marina.com/rays/) swimming by, and accidentally disturbing a [cuttlefish](https://www.paradisedivers.co.uk/blog/cuttlefish/) who was not pleased by our presence, but put on a great show as a result!
Sorry, bud!

### Our feline colleague üêà

All throughout our working sessions, we were accompanied by a very friendly young kitty (name unknown) who consistently offered critical support when we needed it the most.
We can't thank her enough for her contributions to the company roadmap.
