One of the toughest challenges to overcome as a fully remote team is fostering a supportive and inclusive company culture.
How do you build trust, comradery, and‚Äîdare I say it?‚Äîfriendships when there are so few opportunities for spontaneous social interactions in our daily work routines?

At MUI, we've chosen to prioritize in-person company retreats as a way to grow together and cultivate the culture that informs how we operate.

In late June 2022, sixteen of us gathered at a remote private residence on the island of Tenerife.
This was MUI's second company retreat, the first being in Portugal in 2021 when the team was just a fraction of the size it is today.

We had a ton of fun getting to know each other better over oceanic activities, poolside conversations, and incredible catered meals‚Äînot to mention a steady supply of Spanish wine. ü•Ç
Oh, and I guess we got some work done along the way, too? üòÖ

## Destination

![Satellite image of Tenerife](/static/blog/tenerife-retreat/tenerife.jpeg)

Tenerife is a volcanic island off the coast of western Africa that's part of the Canary Islands (Spanish: _Canarias_).
It is the most populous island in the archipelago, and one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world.
Its central defining feature is Mount Teide, the third largest volcano in the world when measured from its base, rising 7,500 m (24,600 ft) from the bottom of the ocean floor.

With an average temperature ranging from about 18-25 ¬∞C (68-77 ¬∞F) year-round, it's hard to pick a bad time to visit!

## Accommodations

[Symbiosis Living](https://www.symbiosisliving.com/) is a sustainable retreat venue nestled deep in the hills on the western side of the island.
The venue is a venerable oasis of lush green flora amid the stark and barren volcanic rock that surrounds it, hosting breezy guest houses adorned with rustic, regionally sourced furniture.

The owners were exceptionally accommodating and supportive for the entirety of our stay.
Almost all of our meals were cooked fresh by the hosts in their fabulous outdoor kitchen.
I don't think I've ever eaten that many incredible home-cooked meals in a single week. üòã
And somehow each one was even better than the last!

## Activities

Throughout our stay in Tenerife, we arranged group activities to make the most of what the island has to offer.

### Whale and dolphin watching

### Scuba diving lessons

### Volcanic hike at sunset

## And also work

### Roadmap to v6 and beyond

### Focus groups

### Our feline colleague üêà

All throughout our working sessions, we were accompanied by a very friendly young kitty (name unknown) who consistently offered critical support when we needed it the most.
We can't thank her enough for her contributions to the company roadmap.
