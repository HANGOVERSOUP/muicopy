## Evolving MUI's core values & behaviors

MUI was founded to grow and serve a community ‚Äî from developers to designers, our core mission has been to enable others to create incredible user experiences with unrivalled speed and ease. 

Along the way, we embraced certain core principles that guided our ways of working ‚Äî how we think, act, and how we innovate has always been grounded in fulfilling the best interests of our community. 

With high levels of freedom, transparency, trust and collaboration, we've have accomplished a great deal together. 

We've grown significantly too ‚Äî both as an internal team and as a broader collective.

As we excitedly look toward the future, it's important to take a moment and appreciate what's led us to where we are today; and to align on what's needed to take us to where we want to be.

That's why, MUI has evolved the core values and behaviors that unite and drive our team.

## How we approached our values revision

Company values show up in some facet of all our roles every day ‚Äî whether we‚Äôre evaluating different ideas, making tough decisions, or determining the biggest priorities.

That's why it's so criticial that we ensure company values are actionable and authentic ‚Äî that they are easily understood and truly shared by every MUIer.

To make that happen, we decided to engage the whole company in a series of discovery and reflection exercises.

Through a combination of videos, surveys, workshops, and shared documentation we made sure to diversify the ways people could contribute to the overall initiative.

Kicking off, everyone was invited to answer 10 questions via an asynchronous survey.

The purpose of this portion was to get a picture of how the existing values were being perceived and actioned throughout the company day to day. It was also to give people an opportunity to express what they felt may be missing and necessary to ensure our future success.

Using keyword and sentiment analysis, we captured clear themes in experience and common language used to describe our culture, which I presented back to the team via recorded video presentation.

At the next stage, folks came together for a synchronous workshop. The purpose of this was to hone in extremely closely on the critical behaviours that we felt needed to be encouraged or discouraged as we scale. 

During the workshop we set a timer to brainstorm as many sticky notes as we could against core questions:

Then, we upvoted any cards that really stood out and resonated with us, and organised these into little clusters based on relatedness. At that point, we came up with a list of words that we felt best-encapsulated each cluster. This became our values "shortlist" which stakeholders would use to influence selection and copywriting.

All of this influenced what's now referred to as our team "pact." (You'll see why.)

## What are MUI's core values today?

After reviewing all team inputs, we identified four core values that reflect the most important themes raised by the team.<br>

Our core four are:<br>

1. Put community first
2. Avoid bureaucracy
3. Chase "better"
4. Trust & deliver together<br>

To delve deeper into the meaning of each value and what it looks like in practice, check out our handbook: <a href="https://www.notion.so/mui-org/Values-behaviors-d3a1e1c60e2a4c0782f770cceada54bd?pvs=4">Values & Behaviors.</a>

You can even watch the "reveal" video that was shared in our internal Slack <a href="https://www.notion.so/mui-org/Values-behaviors-d3a1e1c60e2a4c0782f770cceada54bd?pvs=4#09dc19a420504a3090dc4fbe6a68a543">here</a>!

<b>Put community first</b> underscores our unwavering commitment to anchoring every decision in the best interests of the collective. By "community," we refer to both the user base that we serve and the team that propels us forward. The litmus test for any decision at MUI begins with a simple yet profound query: How does this contribute to our community's progress? We prioritise the needs and feedback of the community, and invest our efforts toward what will bring the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. Putting community first means also that we consciously forge connections. We recognise that deeper mutual understanding fuels collective progress. By investing in relationships, we enhance collaboration, foster productive teamwork, and create a work environment that's as enjoyable as it is efficient.

<b>Avoid bureaucracy</b> is all about staying lean, open, and people-first. One of the core beliefs we hold at MUI is that people are the best experts on when, where, and how they will do their best work. We actively champion this principle by fostering an environment of unparalleled flexibility and autonomy, which serves as a bedrock for sustained excellence. Our dedication to shunning bureaucracy manifests in tangible ways, for instance: Most of our communications and work are in the open. We default to transparency as much as possible. We don't over-structure, add process or hierarchy where it isn't needed. To introduce a process, we need to clearly show how it makes things 10x better than the current approach. We don't have lengthy approvals processes or a formalised chain of command; instead we collaborate as a tight-knit network where anyone can ask about and contribute to anything.

<b>Chase "better"</b> is all about consistently improving in all aspects of our work and raising the bar for quality. It addresses our attitude to risk, feedback, and setbacks too. Genuine innovation demands a fearless embrace of the uncharted, even if it entails a touch of chaos. We want to create the exceptional; not the "good enough" so we tend to prioritise quality over speed. This doesn't mean we wait for things to be perfect before releasing them. On the contrary, chase better encourages us all to make small changes and incremental improvements again and again. It also encourages us to venture into unfamiliar territory and get out of our comfort zones in the name of growth. 

<b>Trust & deliver together</b> is all about building trust, alignment, and shared responsibility. It reflects our commitment to cultivate unity as the core of achievement. In practice, this looks like: doing what we say we will, proactively communicating progress, adapting swiftly to changing circumstances and demands to guarantee success, and readily offering/seeking help when necessary. It's also about strategic collaboration, and being able to recognise and enlist one another for our unique strenghts toward shared goals. We firmly believe that together, our combined efforts are stronger and more impactful than what we can achieve individually.

## How do we reinforce values across the org?

Articulating company values and operationalising them are two different things. To ensure values don't become mere writing on the wall at MUI, we've purposefully wove them into internal processes and programs. We surface them often and stay attuned to on how people are perceiving and connecting to them through different initiatives.

For example, before you even join MUI, you'll answer carefully chosen questions in your interviews. This helps us understand how well you align to our company values and how you might contribute to enhancing them.

On a day to day level, values show up everywhere. They're referenced in discussions and deliberations related to our work. We explicitly state how they directly influence our strategies and plans within our documents. Exemplifying core values is also a condition for promotion here and therefore a topic in performance and development conversations.

As a fun way to reinforce values and show team gratitude, we've also created #Thanks-And-Praise Thursdays ‚Äî a dedicated Slack channel that prompts us every Thursday to think about who we could recognise for championing core values and behaviours. 

Our design team even created custom Slack emojis to make highlighting values-driven moments with just a few clicks.

## When might the values change again?

MUI's first values were set fourth by our founders during the earliest stages of the company, with the recognition that they would transform alongside our company's growth.

Those values remain very foundational to the ways we work and engage. It's quite evident how these have been represented in new ways within the core four.

But we don't expect these to last forever.

As we continue to progress through new stages of development in the coming years, we intentionally plan to review our values ‚Äî ensuring they keep their driving power and authenticity.
