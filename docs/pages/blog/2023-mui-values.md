## Why we chose to revise our core values

MUI was founded in 2014 to grow and serve a community — from developers to designers, our core mission has been to enable others to create incredible user experiences with unrivalled speed and ease. 

Along the way, we embraced certain core principles that guided our ways of working — how we think, act, and how we innovate has always been grounded in fulfilling the best interests of our community.

In 2019, these became formalized in our first-ever company values: user obsession, excellence, transparency, freedom, and autonomy. 

Needless to say, we've grown significantly since then — as a company, product, and broader community too. 

That’s why, we wanted to take a moment to honor the values that led us to where we are today, and share how we’ve reshaped them to be an even more powerful force behind MUI’s next phase of growth. 🚀

## How we approached our values revision

Company values show up in some facet of all our roles every day — whether we’re evaluating different ideas, making tough decisions, or determining the biggest priorities.

That's why, it's so critical to ensure company values are actionable and authentic — that they are easily understood and truly shared by every MUIer.

To make that happen, we decided to engage the whole company in a series of discovery and reflection exercises. 🔍

By doing so, we could make sure that any changes to the company values would accurately reflect the values truly shared by our team, and the language we use to express them. Here’s how we did it! 👇

## Stage one: discovery questions

Kicking off, everyone was invited to answer 10 questions via an asynchronous survey. 

The purpose of this portion was to get a picture of how the existing values were being perceived and action throughout the company on a day today. It was also to give people an opportunity to express what they felt may be *missing* and important to include for our future success.

We asked people to reflect on how accurately they felt each value described our internal culture; what they felt our company cared deeply about and why; what is utterly unique about us as a team; and more. 🤔💭

Then, using keyword and sentiment analysis, we captured clear themes in experience and common language used to describe our culture. I presented this back to the team via recorded video presentation, inviting reactions and further dialogue in the open of our Slack workspace.

## Stage two: workshop

At the next stage, folks came together for a synchronous workshop. (This was completely voluntary, but I’m proud to say we had major representation from all different corners and levels of the company!)

The purpose of this workshop was to pinpoint the *most* critical mindsets and behaviors that we felt underpinned the company’s success at scale. 

Broadly speaking, everyone was asked to consider:

(a) what mindsets and behaviors we should actively preserve and encourage as we scale — these are our superpowers and biggest differentiators. They’re the stuff that makes us “us.” 💚

(b) what mindsets and behaviors should we actively discourage, even punish — these are the biggest threats to our desired culture. They’re the things we would never tolerate, maybe even at the cost of a customer. 🛑

We used a shared FigJam board to brainstorm together against a timer, and repeat the process over for different core questions.

Once we’d generated a wonderfully full board, we took a pause to review the contributions. We upvoted cards that really stood out and resonated with us as individuals.

Finally, we organized all of these cards into little clusters based on relatedness, and started to identify their underlying values and themes.

We came up with a list of words that we felt best-encapsulated each cluster. This became our values "shortlist" which stakeholders would use to influence the final selection and copywriting.

## Stage three: transforming the shortlist

36.

That’s how many words surfaced in our workshop as potential values — or at least, as words to inspire the copywriting process.

Narrowing down the shortlist was both a chance to find the strongest themes to influence team values, and also the chance to stress-test them. 🧪

To do this, we immediately eliminated [what Patrick Lencioni calls “permission-to-play” values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNRn6FimzoU). These are the things as basic as showing respect, which might be *valuable* to a great team culture and performance, but aren’t exactly *exciting* or *measurable*. They’re simply the minimum required standard of behavior to work together.

We also started striking out anything that could not clearly be expressed *as an action.*

It’s what Simon Sinek was talking about when he said, “[Honesty is not a value.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQuYzXWXDqI)” If there was not a clear and natural way to transform something into an action or provide examples of how it would be lived in our specific workplace, it was out. 🙅

Success!

We narrowed the list down from 36 to *just 6.*

Now, it was time to transform these 6 words into actionable phrases to inspire the very actions we want to see championed on a daily basis.

## Stage four: pitching the ‘PACT’

All of the above and more influenced what's now referred to as our team "pact." (You'll see why.)

But before we get there, I want to share a few examples of phrases that didn’t wind up being a part of the pitch and why.

Finding the right phraseology started with carefully reviewing *all* team inputs. As I had a unique vantage point of all those inputs, I began to jot down phrases that effectively pulled from them *all* and led with *action verbs.* 🕸️💪

Things like: “Build in the open” made an appearance, but felt too limited. There was so more we wanted to capture in the enduring theme of transparency, why it matters to us, and how we show it.

Other phrases included: “Own your impact” or “Maximize flexibility” but these, again, felt too limited and also generic. 

In short, they weren’t right.

Fortunately, this helped us find the ones that *****are.***** 👏

I presented a video presentation to our team, pitching this set of values and providing another opportunity for feedback and shaping.

## Stage five: revising and finalising

Since we work asynchronously at MUI, we like to leave a good window of time for peers to properly review, digest, and offer thoughtful feedback.

Since we place such a high — ahem, *************value ************* — on quality and accuracy, we didn’t want to rush this process and extended our deadline for delivery. 

As we approached the finish line, I collaborated closely with our Co-Founder, Olivier. 🙋

Our goal was to ensure that the final values not only reflected our team and company's culture but, most importantly, that they could be effectively integrated into our company's operations and performance expectations.

And we believe we’ve achieved just that! Here they come... 🥁 

## What are MUI's core values today?

Our core four are:

**P** — Put community first. “We never lose sight of who we’re serving and why.” 💙

**A** — Avoid bureaucracy. “We’re so not corporate — and we like it that way.” 🚫

**C** — Chase better. “We’re driven by an unending desire to improve.” 🌱

**T** — Trust & deliver together. “We cultivate unity as the core of achievement.” 🚀

To delve deeper into the meaning of each value and what it looks like in practice, you can also check out our handbook: <a href="https://www.notion.so/mui-org/Values-behaviors-d3a1e1c60e2a4c0782f770cceada54bd?pvs=4">Values & Behaviors.</a>

In it, we offer concrete examples of each core value and explicitly address tensions folks may encounter in trying to live them out.

## What do they mean?

**Put community first** underscores our unwavering commitment to anchoring every decision in the best interests of the collective. 

By "community," we refer to both the user base that we serve and the team that propels us forward. 

The litmus test for any decision at MUI begins with a simple yet profound query: How does this contribute to our community's progress? We prioritise the needs and feedback of the community, and invest our efforts toward what will bring the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. 

Putting community first means also that we consciously forge connections. We recognise that deeper mutual understanding fuels collective progress. By investing in relationships, we enhance collaboration, foster productive teamwork, and create a work environment that's as enjoyable as it is efficient.

**Avoid bureaucracy** is all about staying lean, open, and people-first. One of the core beliefs we hold at MUI is that people are the best experts on when, where, and how they will do their best work. 

We actively champion this principle by fostering an environment of unparalleled flexibility and autonomy, which serves as a bedrock for sustained excellence. 

Our dedication to shunning bureaucracy manifests in tangible ways, for instance: Most of our communications and work are in the open. We default to transparency as much as possible. 

We don't over-structure, add process or hierarchy where it isn't needed. To introduce a process, we need to clearly show how it makes things 10x better than the current approach. 

We don't have lengthy approvals processes or a formalised chain of command; instead we collaborate as a tight-knit network where anyone can ask about and contribute to anything.

**Chase "better”** is all about consistently improving and developing in all aspects of our work as well as raising the bar for quality. 

It addresses our attitude to risk, feedback, and setbacks too. Genuine innovation demands a fearless embrace of the uncharted, even if it entails a touch of chaos. 

We want to create the exceptional; not the "good enough" so we tend to prioritise quality over speed. This doesn't mean we wait for things to be perfect before releasing them. 

On the contrary, chase better encourages us all to make small changes and incremental improvements again and again. 

It also encourages us to venture into unfamiliar territory and get out of our comfort zones in the name of growth. 

**Trust & deliver together** is all about building trust, alignment, and shared responsibility. 

It reflects our commitment to following through and working as one force to solve problems and create value. 

In practice, this looks like: doing what we say we will, proactively communicating progress, adapting swiftly to changing circumstances and demands to guarantee success, and readily offering or seeking help when necessary. 

It's also about strategic collaboration, and being able to recognize and enlist one another for our unique strengths toward shared goals. 

Trust & deliver together reflects our firm belief that together, our combined efforts are stronger and more impactful than what we can achieve individually.

## How do we reinforce values across the org?

Articulating company values and operationalising them are two different things.

To ensure values don't become mere writing on the wall at MUI, we've purposefully wove them into internal processes and programs. We surface them often and stay attuned to on how people are perceiving and connecting to them through different initiatives. 🌠🔦

For example, before you even join MUI, you'll answer carefully chosen questions in your interviews. This helps us understand how well you align to our company values and how you might contribute to enhancing them and our culture. 📝

On a day to day level, values show up everywhere. They're referenced in discussions and deliberations related to our work. We explicitly state how they directly influence our strategies and plans within our documents. Exemplifying core values is also a condition for promotion here and therefore a topic in performance and development conversations. 🆙

As a fun way to reinforce values and show team gratitude, we've also created #Thanks-And-Praise Thursdays — a dedicated Slack channel that prompts us every Thursday to think about who we could recognise for championing core values and behaviours. 

Our design team even created custom Slack emojis to make highlighting values-driven moments with just a few clicks. (Thank you Gerda, Victor, and Danilo!) 🙏

## When might the values change again?

MUI's first values were set fourth by our founders during the earliest stages of the company, with the recognition that they would evolve alongside our company's growth.

Those values remain very foundational to the ways we work and engage. It's quite evident how these have been represented in new ways within the core four.

But we don't expect these to last forever either.

As we continue to progress through new stages of development in the coming years, we intentionally plan to review our values and keep cultivating the culture that underpins our success.
