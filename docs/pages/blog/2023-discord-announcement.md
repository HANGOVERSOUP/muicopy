## Why we are on Discord?

There are a plethora of reasons why we created a Discord server, but ultimately, it came down to 3 things:

1. **Real-time communication with our community**: Discord provides real-time chat capabilities, allowing developers to communicate and collaborate with each other instantly. It offers both text-based channels and voice channels, enabling developers to discuss ideas, share code snippets, troubleshoot issues, and provide feedback in a quick and efficient manner.

2. **Community building**: Discord provides a platform for developers to create and nurture communities around specific topics, programming languages, frameworks, or projects. It allows developers to join or create servers dedicated to their areas of interest, connect with like-minded individuals, and establish a sense of belonging within the developer community.

3. **Networking and collaboration opportunities**: Discord provides an environment where developers can network with industry professionals, find mentors, and collaborate on projects. It allows them to seek guidance, share knowledge, and participate in discussions with experienced developers, potentially leading to career opportunities or valuable collaborations.

Overall, Discord's combination of real-time communication, community building features, organizational capabilities, and developer-friendly features make it a valuable tool for our community to connect, collaborate, and grow together.
