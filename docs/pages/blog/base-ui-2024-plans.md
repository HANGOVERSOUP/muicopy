The [story of Base UI](/blog/introducing-base-ui/) began several years agoâ€”long before headless React component libraries skyrocketed in popularityâ€”when we started to imagine a world in which Material UI could exist without Material Design.

We're super excited to share that this dream has become a reality!
This year will see a lot of investment in Base UI as we expand the team ([we're hiring!](/careers/staff-ui-engineer-base-ui/)) and focus hard on a [stable release](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/milestone/46) (tentatively planned for late 2024), which will come full of new components, features, and improvements.

Let's walk through some of the things we're cooking up.

## A larger set of components

Base UI today offers a modest set of components and hooks, including some slightly more complex ones such as [Autocomplete](/base-ui/react-autocomplete/) and [Number Input](/base-ui/react-number-input/).
However, we're aware that the package is still missing many primitive components that developers would need in order to adopt it for real-world applications.
Fear not, because we're working hard to ship all of the components listed below with the stable release:

| Components to be added |                                                                                                |
| :--------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Accordion              | [View&nbsp;the&nbsp;GitHub&nbsp;issue&nbsp;â†’](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/38037) |
| Alert Dialog           |                [View the GitHub issue&nbsp;â†’](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/40886) |
| Checkbox               |                [View the GitHub issue&nbsp;â†’](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/38036) |
| Collapsible            |                [View the GitHub issue&nbsp;â†’](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/40959) |
| Drawer                 |                [View the GitHub issue&nbsp;â†’](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/38181) |
| Radio Group            |                [View the GitHub issue&nbsp;â†’](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/38038) |
| Tooltip                |                [View the GitHub issue&nbsp;â†’](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/38045) |

## Improved customization API

Currently, Base UI components can be customized to your heart's content using the `slots` and `slotProps` props.
(Read more about them in the "[Overriding component structure](/base-ui/guides/overriding-component-structure/)" guide.)

```tsx
// Example of the slots prop
<Select slots={{ listbox: 'ol' }} defaultValue="First option">
  <Option value="First option">First option</Option>
  <Option value="Second option">Second option</Option>
</Select>

// Example of the slotProps prop
<Badge slotProps={{ badge: { className: 'my-badge' } }} />
```

This API, while powerful, has proven to be less than ideal in some instances.
Most notably, it's too lengthy and complicated to write and read when used with libraries such as Tailwind CSS.
Additionally, since the `slots` and the corresponding `slotProps` are not related in terms of TypeScript types, it's possible to introduce bugs or have the compiler complain about valid code.

To address these issues, we're considering adopting a new API that would assign a discrete subcomponent to each DOM nodeâ€”the pattern favored by many other headless component libraries (think: `<Slider.Track />`, `<Slider.Thumb />`, etc.).
This pattern has the potential to radically improve the customization experience, both for styles and structure.
We're still fleshing out the details and plan to release an RFC on GitHub in the coming daysâ€”we'll update this blog post with the link when it's available.
We know that a significant number of projects depend on the existing API, and we want to assure you that one of our top priorities is to provide a smooth migration experience.

## More thorough animation support

Animation is a key element for adding delight to any application.
We've already kicked off work on animation support by releasing the [CSS Transition](/base-ui/react-transitions/#css-transition) and [CSS Animation](/base-ui/react-transitions/#css-animation) components, as well as the `useTransitionTrigger` and `useTransitionStateManager` hooks.
They're currently available for use with the Popup, Menu, and Select, and the plan is to extend support to more components while also adding more features.

{{"demo": "../../data/base/components/transitions/AllTransitionsDemo.js"}}

<p class="blog-description" style="margin: -16px 0 0 0;">The CSS Animation transition is exaggerated here for the sake of demonstration.</p>

## Independent component versioning

Instead of versioning the package as a whole, we're considering offering each Base UI component as its own individual npm package with its own version.
Although it may initially sound like a burden to install each component individually, it means that you only have to commit to those you're actually interested in using.
Pick and choose only what you need, or even mix and match with complementary component libraries that you're already using.

This would be a huge DX win because it enables us to iterate much more quickly on individual components and get bug fixes out to you on a per-component basis with no need to wait for a package-wide major release.

## A more independent product

Thus far, all Base UI-related development has happened within the [Material UI GitHub repository](http://github.com/mui/material-ui).
That made a lot of sense in the beginning because we didn't intend for Base UI to be a standalone product at the time.
As a result of this early decision, we've seen that some developers are hesitant to try it out because of the apparent association with Material Design.
Rest assured that Base UI _is_ a standalone library, and it doesn't come packaged with _any_ default styles or themes.
That's why, later in the year, we plan to move it to its own dedicated GitHub repository.

Base UI is no longer _merely_ "Material UI without the styles"â€”as we've seen with developer trends over the last few years, the potential for growth and adoption of headless components could actually dwarf Material UI in the near future.
To acknowledge that Base UI has the potential to outgrow Material UI, we plan to move it to its own dedicated GitHub repo for more focused communication and collaboration with the community that's growing around it.

## Getting bugs out of the way

The core of what Base UI strives to deliver out of the box is first-class accessibility and an intuitive API for extensive customization.
We've earmarked several bugs we want to tackle before the stable release in areas such as keyboard navigation, better ARIA support, focus styles, and more.
