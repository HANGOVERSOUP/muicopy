As we approach the end of 2023, we've had our heads down working on some very exciting projects for the future of Material UI in the next year.
We reevaluated our major versioning strategy and concluded that we need to ship smaller releases more frequently.
Read on to learn why, and find out more about our plans for v6 _and_ v7 of Material UI in 2024.

## Two major releases

One of the biggest lessons we learned during the v4 to v5 cycle is that smaller major releases with fewer breaking changes are the way to go.
Many developers expressed how frustrating it was to migrate to v5 when it shipped in late 2021, and we can definitely empathize!
We want to make sure that never happens again.
That means you can expect more gradual updates spread out across two major releases in 2024.
Here's what we're planning for each:

### Material UI v6

With the stable version planned for Q2 of 2024, the primary focus of Material UI v6 is releasing a new [zero-runtime CSS-in-JS styling engine](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/38137), which will pave the way for compatibility with React Server Components and add significant performance improvements.
We're building it so that the upgrade will be opt-in, which means you won't need to commit to it immediately.

As a taste of the performance upgrade, here are some early Lighthouse metrics with a couple of primary components running on an M1 MacBook Pro with 16 GB of RAM:

| Total Blocking Time (TBT) in milliseconds (ms) | Emotion | Zero-runtime |
| :--------------------------------------------- | ------: | -----------: |
| Case #1: 1,000 Buttons                         |  223.33 |          100 |
| Case #2: 1,000 Outlined inputs                 |  583.33 |         3.33 |

### Material UI v7

Material UI v7 is tentatively planned for Q4 of 2024.
That's when you can expect to see native support for [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/), Google's latest Material Design update, as well as many other design improvements across the component suite.

In fact, the work for this version has already started!
See which components are already available using the experimental `@mui/material-next` package, that supports the Material 3 specs, by visiting the newly released All Components page.

**WIP note, to be deleted**: The above-mentioned page is going to be added on a separate PR. I'll remove this comment before publish this post.

## From design to development

In addition to what you'll get from the React library, we've also been working on a Figma plug-in to help bridge the gap between designers and developers.
We're getting super close to a first release, and it is, for now, custom-tailored to work nicely along the [Material UI Design Kits](/material-ui/getting-started/design-resources/).

We're calling it MUI Connect, which will enable you to customize Material UI components on Figma and export them to code directly, making collaboration with developers using the React library a much smoother process.

## A sharper focus

To pull these releases off, the Core team's attention will be fully focused on Material UI for most of 2024.
In the meantime we're putting Joy UI development on hold, so don't expect any new features or components.
Nevertheless, we do have some big ideas for Joy UI!
Expect to hear more about that towards the end of Q2 '24.

## Follow along and contribute

We've consolidated the v6 changes in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/30660)â€”please feel free to chime in and participate in the discussions!
You can also always check the [public Material UI project board](https://github.com/orgs/mui/projects/18/views/5) to see the planned releases and their respective umbrella issues.

We hope you're as excited as we are about these changes!
Have a wonderful holiday season and a Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰
