As we approach the end of 2023, we've got our heads down working on some very exciting projects for the future of Material UI in the next year.
We've reevaluated our major versioning strategy and concluded that we need to ship smaller, and more frequently.
Read on to learn why, and find out more about our plans for v6 _and_ v7 of Material UI in 2024.

<img alt="A summary about the major changes coming in Material UI v6 and v7" src="/static/blog/2023-material-ui-v6-and-beyond/post-header.jpg" width="1200" height="600" loading="lazy" />

## Two major releases

One of the biggest lessons we learned during the v4 to v5 cycle is that smaller major releases with fewer breaking changes are the way to go.
Many developers expressed how frustrating it was to migrate to v5 when it shipped in late 2021, and we can definitely empathize!
We want to make sure that never happens again.
That means you can expect more gradual updates spread out across two major releases in 2024.
Here's what we're planning for each:

### Material UI v6

With the stable version planned for Q2 of 2024, the primary focus of Material UI v6 is releasing a new [zero-runtime CSS-in-JS styling engine](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/38137), which will pave the way for compatibility with React Server Components and add significant performance improvements.
We're building it so that the upgrade will be opt-in, which means you won't need to commit to it immediately.

### Material UI v7

Material UI v7 is tentatively planned for Q4 of 2024.
That's when you can expect to see native support for [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/), Google's latest Material Design update, as well as many other design improvements across the component suite.

## A sharper focus

To pull these releases off, the Core team's attention will be fully focused on Material UI for most of 2024.
In the meantime, we're putting Joy UI development on hold, so don't expect any new features or components for that library.
But we do have some big ideas for Joy UI nonetheless!
Expect to hear more about that towards the end of Q2 '24.
