As we approach the end of 2023, we're heads down working on very exciting projects for the future of Material UI in the next year.
Here's what you can expect:

## Two major releases

One of the biggest lessons we learned during the v4 to v5 cycle is that smaller, less breaking major releases are the way to go.
Many developers pointed out how frustrated they were to migrate to the newest version back then, and we definitely want to make it easier this time around, particularly because we'll launch **two major** versions in 2024!
That means you can expect more gradual updates, and here's what we're planning for them:

### Material UI v6

With the stable version planned for Q2 of 2024, the primary focus of this version is releasing a new, zero runtime, CSS-in-JS styling engine, which will enable compatibility with React Server Components and add significant performance improvements!
We're building it so that the upgrade will be opt-in, which means you won't need to commit to it immediately.

### Material UI v7

Tentatively planned for Q4 of 2024, that's when you should expect to see native support for Material 3, Google's latest Material Design update, as well as many other design improvements across the component suite.

## A sharper focus

To pull these releases off, the Core team's attention, within the style library space, is fully focused on Material UI.
Therefore, you shouldn't expect any new features or components for Joy UI in the meantime.
But that doesn't mean we aren't cooking up interesting things regarding that!
Expect to hear more about it towards the end of Q2 of 2024.

## Follow along and contribute

We've consolidated the v6 changes in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/30660), so you can chime in and participate in the discussions!
You can also always check the public Material UI roadmap to see the planned releases from a high-level and their respective umbrella issues.

We hope you're as excited as we are about these changes!
Have a wonderful holiday season and a Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰
