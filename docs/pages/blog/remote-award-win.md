## Small & Mighty winners

The awards, presented by [Remote](/www.remote.com/), recognize companies that have demonstrated exceptional commitment, innovation, and enthusiasm in navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by remote work.

The awards celebrate MUI's efforts driving success in the realm of remote work and distributed teams and provide a roadmap of effective strategies and practices for other businesses to follow.
The winners across 10 categories were selected through a rigorous evaluation process by a panel of judges, comprising Remote's leaders and a panel of influential industry figures, considering factors such as employee engagement, impact on employee engagement and productivity, and technology adoption.

In judging, Hailley Griffis, Head of Communications & Content at Buffer remarked:

> MUI is the definition of small and mighty. I am blown away by their commitment to building a company in their own way while achieving powerful results for themselves, their community, and their customers.
