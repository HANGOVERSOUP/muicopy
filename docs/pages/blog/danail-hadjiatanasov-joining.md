We are excited to share that [Danail Hadjiatanasov](https://twitter.com/danail_h) has joined Material-UI. It's his first full-time week and is now part of the enterprise team.

For the past 3 years, Danail has been working in a company called [Backbase](https://www.backbase.com/). He was responsible for building a UI library based on Angular that was specifically designed for banks. The UI library and its corresponding design system were sold under a commercial license and today some of the biggest names in the banking industry have web applications powered by those UI components (RBC, Central 1, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, and others). Although he was working with Angular his true passion is React hacking side projects with it. He's extremely happy to be part of Material-UI’s team and help expand the product even more.

Danail is off to a running start, he has landed his first feature in the data grid: the column [reordering](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/columns/#column-reorder):

</video>

He's now actively working on new features for the data grid.

The enterprise team will continue developing the data grid component, and progressively extend to new advanced components as we grow the team. Here's a quick view of [the enterprise roadmap](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x/projects/1).

We couldn’t be more excited to have Danail on the team! You can follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danail_h).
