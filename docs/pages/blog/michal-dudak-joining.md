We are excited to share that [Michał Dudak](https://twitter.com/michaldudak) has joined Material-UI!
He started a couple of days ago full-time and is part of the core components team.

Before joining Material-UI, Michał worked as a full-stack engineer at Future Processing, a high-end development agency in Poland.
He has been a professional practitioner in the field for over a decade.
He admires great designs and clever solutions.
Writing CSS is a pleasure for him.

We were impressed by his technical challenge.
He has leveraged most of the best practices we enforce when writing components without prior experience contributing to our codebase.

While we can't predict the future, Michał is now responsible for the development of a new vertical for Material-UI: the unstyled & headless React components. Marija has initated this effort with a couple of new modules under the [@material-ui/unstyled](https://unpkg.com/browse/@material-ui/unstyled@next/) package.
This is a strategical effort for us with the intent to solve two problems:

1. Share logic between Material Design and the second different design specifications [Jun will work on](/blog/siriwat-kunaporn-joining/). This is important to stay efficient.
2. Grow the audience of the library. It provides a new customization tradeoff. It maximize for freedom and low bundle-size footprint. We have recently crossed the [20%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l5j3Xjtvm9XZtmb4ulLiWElQaXSlZlyCWT5ONrQMpBo/edit#gid=0) market share threshold inside the React ecosystem (@material-ui/core downloads divided by react-dom downloads). We aim for [+20%](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=@angular/core,@angular/material,@angular/cdk) of the market coming from this effort in the next four years.

Michał is the third of a series of five new positions we have recently opened and filled.
We will reach 11 people at the end of June.
We have opened these positions as our revenue growth allows.
These new roles will help accelerate our mission, strengthen our existing offering, and initiate a new vertical. You can find the next positions we aim to fill in [the Career page](https://material-ui.com/company/careers/#future-roles).

We couldn't be more excited to have Michał on the team!
