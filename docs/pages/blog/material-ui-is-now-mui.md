Starting today, we are evolving our brand identity. We are clarifying the difference between our company and our products.

- Material-UI: the organization is now called [**MUI**](https://github.com/mui-org/).
- Material-UI: the MIT React library is now called [**MUI Core**](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui).
- Material-UI X: the set of advanced React components is now called [**MUI X**](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x).

The new identity matches with the increase scope of our focus.

## The origin

Material-UI started as a React implementation of the Material Design guidelines in 2014.
The goal was simple, to empower the React developers to use Material Design.
The community [loved it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8582439) and was craving for more, so we kept building.

We have made it smooth for the community to contribute.
We started actively reviewing pull requests and guiding issues.
Things started to really take off with [the release of v1](/blog/material-ui-v1-is-out/) in 2018.
The frontend community was actively migrating to React and in desperate need to move fast.

Before we realized it, we had grown into the most popular React UI components library.
We were heavily used and customized to build: customer-facing applications, internal tools, and mobile-hybrid applications.

## A larger focus

In our last survey, [60% fewer](/blog/2020-developer-survey-results/#comparison-with-last-year) developers were complaining about improving Material Design implementation than they did a year before.
At the same time, 400% more developers were struggling to customize the components.

It's the context in which we started working on v5 in 2019.
Our primary focus was to revamp the **customization DX**.
It had become clear that design and DX were key to unlock the next stage of growth.

The release of this rebranding matches with the release of v5.0.0.
It's a big deal.
The new branding aligns with the increase of the company's area of focus.

Our ultimate goal is to become the most effective and efficient tool to build UIs while making it accessible to the many.

## Our new brand

Let's dig in.

### A new name

We are breaking the strong association with Material Design.
We have seen too many people confusing Material-UI with a Google effort or a synonym of Material Design.

We are now called **MUI**, it stands for **M**aterials to Build **UI**s.
and is pronounced [/ɛmjuːaɪ/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%C9%9Bmju%CB%90a%C9%AA).

It's shorter, it distinguishes ourselves, it's already how many people abbreviate us.
More importantly, it prepares the release of unstyled/headless components, a second design system to complement Material Design, and more.

### A new domain name

A new name wouldn't resonate without a new domain name.
We have moved home from https://material-ui.com/ to https://mui.com/, an 3 domain laters domain.

### New logos

The logo of the company is evolving:

- We have reduced the emphasis on the smart 3D perspective. It's a step away from the notion of elevation in Material Design with a single color.
- We have rebalanced the proportions and equilibrium of the letters.
- We have added a slight border-radius to soften the angles.

We are introducing logos for each of our products:

### New package names

The package names have changed in v5, which is a **breaking change**, you can find more details in the release notes.
The npm organization name has moved from @material-ui to [@mui](https://www.npmjs.com/org/mui).

### A new website & documentation

We used this opportunity to tell a different story about the company and its products, positioning us in a broader space.
We better explain and share what we do and who we are.
We have created a custom brand identity, away from Material Design.
For instance, you will find this custom color palette:

<img loading="lazy" src="/static/blog/material-ui-is-now-mui/palette.png" alt="" style="width: 408px; margin-bottom: 16px;" />

[Head to the new website](/).
Note that these changes are **not** impacting the design of the components released under the `@mui/material` npm package.

## The path ahead

Most of this update has been rolled out, we will fix inconsistencies as we spot them.
