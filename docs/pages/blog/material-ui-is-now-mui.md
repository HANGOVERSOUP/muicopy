Starting today, we are evolving our brand identity. We are clarifying the difference between our company and our products.

- Material-UI: the organization is now called [**MUI**](https://github.com/mui-org/).
- Material-UI: the set of foundational MIT React components is now called [**MUI Core**](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui).
- Material-UI X: the set of advanced React components is now called [**MUI X**](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x).

The new identity matches with the increased scope of our focus.

## The origin

Material-UI started as a React implementation of the Material Design guidelines in 2014.
The goal was simple, to empower the React developers to use Material Design.
The community [loved it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8582439) and was craving for more, so we kept building.

We have made it smooth for the community to contribute.
We started actively reviewing pull requests and guiding issues.
Things started to really take off with [the release of v1](/blog/material-ui-v1-is-out/) in 2018.
The frontend community was actively migrating to React, in desperate need to transition quickly,

Before we realized it, we had grown into the most popular React UI components library.
The components were heavily used and customized to build customer-facing applications, internal tools, and mobile-hybrid apps.

## A larger focus

In our last survey, the number of developers that complained about improving Material Design implementation was down by [60%](/blog/2020-developer-survey-results/#comparison-with-last-year) compared to the year before.
At the same time, 400% more developers were struggling to customize the components.

It is based on this context that we started to work on v5 in 2019.
Our primary focus was to revamp the **customization DX**.
It had become clear that design (aesthetic, UX) and DX were key to unlock the next stage of growth.

The new branding comes to support the v5.0.0 release while also creating space for new initiatives that broaden the company horizon. It's a big deal!

Our ultimate goal is to become the most effective and efficient tool to build UIs while making it accessible to the many.

## Our new brand

Let's dig in.

### A new name

We are breaking the strong association with Material Design.
We have seen too many people confusing Material-UI with a Google effort or a synonym of Material Design.

We are now called **MUI**. It stands for **M**aterials to build **UI**s
and is pronounced [/ɛmjuːaɪ/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%C9%9Bmju%CB%90a%C9%AA).

It's shorter, it distinguishes ourselves and it's familiar - many people already used it for abbreviating us.
More importantly, it allows for the release of products not directly coupled to Material Design, such as unstyled/headless version of the components, a brand new second design system as an alternative to MD, and more.

### A new domain name

A new name wouldn't be so official without a new domain.
So, we have moved home from https://material-ui.com/ to https://mui.com/, a very easy-to-type (and find) 3 letters domain.

### New logos

We've tightened up the company's logo to match the new branding.

It's basically the same, to keep it familiar.
We're keeping the geometrical shape, to resonate with the _building blocks_ idea of the components.
We're also reducing the emphasis on the smart 3D perspective, stepping away from the notion of elevation Material Design coined.

To better identify, market, and promote each product, we are introducing logos for each one of them.

### New package names

The package names have changed in v5, which is a **breaking change**, you can find more details in the release notes.
The npm organization name has moved from @material-ui to [@mui](https://www.npmjs.com/org/mui).

### A new website & documentation

Lastly, to celebrate and start a new chapter of the company, together with v5.0.0 rolling out and new products in the making, we're introducing a brand new marketing website and documentation design.

You'll find a completely different theme from Material Design, new typeface, colors, box-shadows, etc.
All done using the sophisticated theming features.
We want to position the company in a broader space, better explain and share what we do and who we are.

> Note that these changes are **not** impacting the design of the components released under the `@mui/*` npm packages.

## The path ahead

We have a lot of exciting stuff to come in the near future as we roll into this new chapter.
We're grateful to have you together with us, supporting the library and making it grow bigger and bigger.
If you spot any errors or inconsistencies, please warn us so we fix them.

Material Design will continue to be supported with the same attention to detail as before.
We hope to keep serving those who like the library for closely following MD while also leveraging the strong foundation built so far to offer new components, designs, and products.

Hope you like it and happy building!
