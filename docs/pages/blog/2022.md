Hi MUI community, I and the core team are giving you our best wishes for a fantastic 2023 year ahead!

This post uses this beginning of a year as an opportunity to look back, celebrate our accomplishments, and share where we are steering the open-source projects, products, and company in 2023.

## KPIs, progress on our mission

Our [mission](https://mui-org.notion.site/Direction-d8b8c142a6a44e3aa963f26edf4e03db#c3479698694645ff906efae69d442be2) is to enable developers at every level of ability to build UIs that feel amazing and faster.
The growth of these key metrics quantify some of our progress:

- üì¶ From 10.8M to 16.5M downloads per month. Our market share compared to React downloads slightly grew in 2022, we are a bit above 23%.
- üìà From 5.96M to 7.63M unique visitors per year on the documentation.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è From 74.0k to 83.9k GitHub stars, leave us [yours üåü](https://github.com/mui/material-ui).
  The project became the most stared React UI library ü•á.
  The position was hold by Ant Design since 2019.
- üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ From 2,396 to [2,681](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/graphs/contributors) contributors, +285.
- üí∞ Grew financial support by 2.0X in 2022, compared to 2021.
- üè¢ From 14 to 26 full-time equivalent team members.

We are proud of this progress, in the [continuity of 2021](/blog/2021/).

## In review

2022 has been a transformational year on many different levels.
I think that 2022 is synonymous with an important evolution of what MUI is about.
We see increasingly more developers using MUI without using Material UI.

We push throught the year with a strategy of expension beyond Material Design because design trends are polarizing and developers keep asking so much of us that goes beyond.
Our increased headcount allowed us to widen the product scope.
We saw the first signs of success doing such, the community responded positively to MUI Base and Joy UI alpha releases.

During the year, this lead the MUI Core team to have a bit less bandwidth to focus on Material UI and collaboration with the open-source community than before.
For example, [I](https://github.com/oliviertassinari) withdraw from almost all the maintenance work on Material UI, where I would spend 80h/week on average in 2019 almost focusing exclusively on "maintaince": reviewing open PRs and closing GitHub issues, leaving little room for big new features.
So new hires joined to consolidate the team.

To allow this expansion beyond Material Design, we had to differentiate the open-source project from the organization working on it.
We [renamed](/blog/material-ui-is-now-mui/) the organization to MUI and kept Material UI for the open-source project.
While this change had some success, the community still vastly confuses MUI as a shorthand for Material UI.

On the otherhand, we were uncertain about how the community would react to the introduction of the [Pricing](https://mui.com/pricing/) page.
It was the first time that we would clearly show to all new developers adopting Material UI that the open-source project is part of a larger MUI organization with an open-core business model.
This did create confusion, we see a constant flow of people asking what's licensed MIT and what's not, but overall, it was a lot smoother than we expected. The growth of the KPIs is one testament of this.
Actually, I suspect that transparency about our business model helped overall convert more teams to MUI knowing that it's here to stay and the project has more resources than they can justify allocating internally to recreate the components from scratch.
It's important we don't forget that the role of our organization is to be a [great steward](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd) for the open source community.

## Achievements

### MUI Base alpha release

<a href="/blog/introducing-mui-base/"><img src="/static/blog/introducing-mui-base/hero-image.png" style="width: 692px; aspect-ratio: 132/61; margin-bottom: 24px;" alt="Demo components built with MUI Base, a newly introduced library of unstyled components and hooks" /></a>

In mid-2020, [@michaldudak](https://github.com/michaldudak) started to work on [#6218](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/6218).
The goal is to allow developers to use Material UI but without the default styles, one level lower in the abstraction stack. This is how [MUI Base](/blog/introducing-mui-base/) was borned:

```jsx
import SelectUnstyled from '@mui/base/SelectUnstyled';
import OptionUnstyled from '@mui/base/OptionUnstyled';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <SelectUnstyled>
      <OptionUnstyled>{/* option one */}</OptionUnstyled>
      <OptionUnstyled>{/* option two */}</OptionUnstyled>
    </SelectUnstyled>
  );
}
```

<p class="blog-description">Example with <a href="https://mui.com/base/react-select/">an headless select.</a></p>

The alpha version [started](https://twitter.com/MUI_hq/status/1570695041034731520) to find its audience.
For example, React's downloads grew by +49% YoY in 2022 and so did MUI at a slightly faster pace. Normalized to React downloads, Material UI downloads slightly decreased, while MUI Base downloads grew faster which put MUI ahead overall.

### Joy UI alpha release

Joy UI provides a default look & feel targetted as tech startups.

1. Finished up the MVCs and announcing the new products: Joy UI & MUI Base (stable release is coming up in the end of Q1 2023)
2. Support for CSS variables in the MUI System & Material UI (as an experimental feature - will become stable in v6. It's already used on our docs)
3. Improvements on the System performance & added feature to allow customizing it's behavior (the sx prop)
4. Started with the adoption of Material You - theme structure & one example component
5. React 18 support - various bug fixes & migrating the docs to React 18

- fixed dark mode flickering utilizing the new CSS variables API
