A few months ago, right in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak, [Damien Tassone](https://twitter.com/madKakoO) has joined our company. He's the first full-time member to focus on the enterprise components of Material-UI. Back then, we had only made a quick mention of it. It's never too late to properly introduce him.

Previously to joining, Damien has been working in the finance industry for a decade in London. Part of the initial, Agile Market team at RBS, and more recently leading a large Commodity Trading application at Adaptive, Damien has developed his React experience as part of large projects where Components driven design plays a huge role in delivering application successfully. He loves TypeScript.
I was impressed with his energy and passion for solving UI problems.

Right from the beginning, he has made fast and significative progress. He has been an amazing addition to the team, thanks to him, we are on the verge to release a new advanced component: the [Data Grid](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid).

You can follow Damien on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/madKakoO) to see his progress. The enterprise team will continue developing the data grid component, and progressively extend its scope of interest to new advanced components, as we grow the team.
