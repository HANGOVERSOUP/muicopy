This year, one of our highest priorities has been to create a central hub for the MUI community.
Up until now, our community has been scattered across discussions and interactions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MUI_hq), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/mui), [GitHub](https://github.com/mui), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/material-ui).

That's why we've officially launched our [Discord Server](https://mui.com/r/discord/)‚Äîand we'd love for you to be a part of our community!

Come join to engage in lively discussions, share your projects, and interact with the MUI team as well as developers just like you from all around the world.

## Why you should join our Discord Server?

There are a plethora of reasons why you should join, but here are the three biggest benefits:

1. **Real-time communication with our community**:
   As mentioned above, our communication with the community has often been slow and _scattered_ across too many different platforms.
   Developers are frequently unsure whether to open an issue on Github, tweet at us, or send us an email when they have a question or want to share feedback.

   _Discord provides real-time chat capabilities_, allowing you to communicate and collaborate with us and other developers, instantly.

   What's a better way to get a real-time response from the MUI team and other users?!

2. **Community building**:
   Want to hear what the MUI team is up to?
   Get the latest update with the products you're using?
   Want to give us real-time feedback?
   Heck, do you want to see if others are facing the same issue you're having?
   Discord is a great place for us to get together and chat! (Keep a lookout for #voice-meetups!)

3. **Networking and collaboration opportunities**:
   We want this to be a safe place where you can join, have fun, and meet new people.
   Someone is out there using this same tool as you(_ahem_, MUI).
   We created two awesome channels to help you find work opportunities (and we can always create more‚Äîjust let us know what you need)!
   1. üé® ‚îÇ Show-Off
      - Show off your MUI projects! Get wild. Ask questions.
        If you have MUI related questions that is blocking you from your project, ask here.
        Someone may be facing it as well.
        Or use this channel simply to boast. üòâ
   2. üìù ‚îÇ Freelance
      - Looking for some help on completing your vision?
        Use this channel to find work or market yourself for work.
        There are thousands of developers, designers, and teams using MUI.
        You're bound to find someone to help you complete your project.

Overall, Discord's combination of real-time communication, community building features, organizational capabilities, and developer-friendly features make it a valuable tool for our community to connect, collaborate, and grow together!
