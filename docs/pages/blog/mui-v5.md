- [Design kits](#design-kits)

## A new branding

- I wonder if we shouldn't have a second blog post for this ü§î
- v5 is the biggest major we have released to date, e.g. more work went into it than v1.
- A new branding to shift developers's perception on the library, encourage them to update their previous perception on it. makeStyles -> styled + sx + dynamic theme is meant to be **major** a DX improvement.
- e.g. https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2021/05/05/bootstrap-5/#new-logo

## High-level goals for v5

Give the backstory to the developers, make us accountable for spending 1 year+ on a major + breaking changes and not on improving the v4 they already use.

- Link the RFC with the initial plan https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/20012
- What v5 is mostly about: solve the pain reported in https://material-ui.com/blog/2020-developer-survey-results/. in the end, it was mostly about customizability.

## Improved customizability

### Migration from JSS to emotion

- Settle on the name, emotion vs. Emotion
- Explain the problem, the solution
- Like the extensive research that Marija did https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/22342
- Thanks community members that helped to make the migration of the codebase happen, it was long and fastidous
- Explain what's the migration path for JSS: `@material-ui/styles`
- We have started sponsoring emotion $1,000/month

### The `sx` prop

- Explain the problem, the solution
- Also available as flatten props https://material-ui.com/blog/2021-q1-update/.
- Explain why no support of flatten on all the components (a popular request)
- The community seems to love it https://twitter.com/AnsonLowZF/status/1397034690771443715

### Dynamic props

- Explain the problem, the solution
- Covered a bit in https://material-ui.com/blog/2020-q3-update/, https://material-ui.com/blog/2021-q1-update/

```jsx
const theme = createMuiTheme({
  components: {
    MuiButton: {
      variants: [
```

```jsx
import { createMuiTheme, Button } from '@material-ui/core';

// 1. Extend the theme.
const theme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    neutral: {
      main: '#5c6ac4',
    },
  },
});

// 2. Notify TypeScript about the new color in the palette
declare module '@material-ui/core/styles' {
  interface Palette {
    neutral: Palette['primary'];
  }
  interface PaletteOptions {
    neutral: PaletteOptions['primary'];
  }
}

// 3. Profit
<Button color="neutral"  />
```

### Global class names

- Explain the problem, the solution

### Hook only components

- Explain the problem, the solution: isolate the logics of the existing components into standalone hooks).

## Support of multiple adapters

- styled-components
- ask for help on goober https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/27776

## A new product line: X

- Present the new Data Grid component, hopefully, released as v5.0.0 at the same time.

## Change on the supported platforms

- Updated TypeScript version
- Updated node.js version
- Updated React's version
- Updated browsers support. Stop all work on IE 11, but specific IE 11 will only be removed in v6.
  Moving IE 11 to a different bundle has allowed saving [-6kB](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/22814#issuecomment-700995216) overall.

## Improved DX

- Warn that `@material-ui/styles` is not compatible

## v4 migration
