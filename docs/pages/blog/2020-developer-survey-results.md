# 2020 Material-UI Developer Survey results

While we are currently working on the upcoming release of Material-UI v5, we need to prioritize our
roadmap for the coming year. To refine our focus, we launched a developer survey few months back,
to which we received 1488 contributions. This year we had twice as more contributions than last year,
so thank you for your participation!
The survey is now closed and this is a summary of the results.

The survey was broken into three sections, "Introduction", "About you" and "Your product".

## Introduction

Here we asked for the good, the bad and the ugly. Thankfully, it's mostly good, but we can focus
on the things that will make it even better.

### 1. How would you feel if you could no longer use Material-UI?

An overwhelming majority of respondents (over 94%), would be disappointed or very disappointed if
they could no longer use Material-UI. The benchmark for "very disappointed" is 40%,
so we're on the right track. Don't worry, Material-UI isn't going away any time soon –
we want to focus on making even more of you "very disappointed", as it were!

### 2. How likely is it that you would recommend Material-UI to a friend or colleague?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/2a.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Bar chart: 0.20% -	1, 0% - 2, 0.20% - 3, 0.20% - 4, 1.02% - 5, 1.97% - 6, 8.71% - 7, 22.52% - 8, 20.88% - 9, 44.29% - 10" />

Developers gave Material-UI a [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter)
(promoters less detractors) of 61.54%. Given the NPS range of -100 to +100, a “positive” score or NPS
above 0 is considered “good”, +50 is “Excellent”, and above 70 is considered “world class.”

### 3. Who do you think would most benefit from Material-UI?

This word cloud was generated with [wordclouds.com](https://wordclouds.com).

Developers, developers, developers! (And "people" and "teams" in general, apparently! ) This is understandable, given the
[job role demographic](#7-which-of-the-following-best-describes-your-current-job-role)
of the majority of respondents. We'll continue to work on the developer experience, making it
easier to get started with, use, and customize Material-UI.

### 4. What is the main benefit you receive from Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/4.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Word cloud of the main benefit of Material-UI" />

The responses variously commented on being able to focus on the business logic, faster development,
good looking components, ease of use, design consistency, good documentation.
We'll make sure that we continue to do more of the things that benefit you the most.

### 5. How can we improve Material-UI for you?

We have grouped the answers into different categories.
The prefix corresponds to the number of times the concern was mentioned.
It’s sorted descending, with the most important concerns first:
