# 2020 Material-UI Developer Survey results

Marija Najdova, Olivier Tassinari, Matt Brookes. June 24, 2019.

Continuing the tradition from last year, we launched a developer survey few months ago, to which we received 1488 contrivutions. This is twice as many as last year, so we thank you all for the participation!
The survey is now closed and here we will give a detailed summary of the results.

The survey again was broken into three sections, "Introduction", "About you" and "Your product".

## Introduction

In this section we mostly wanted to hear what do developers think is going good and we should keep doing, and which are the areas where we need to improve the library to make it even better.

### 1. How would you feel if you could no longer use Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/1.png" style="width: 552px; margin-top: 32px; margin-bottom: 24px;" alt="Pie chart: 73.3% Very disappointed, 21.3% somewhat disappointed, 5.4% not disappointed." />

Over 94% of the respondents would be disappointed of they can no longer use Material-UI, which is really a nice percentage. We will keep working hard and hopefully move more of you into the "very disappointed" category soon!

### 2. How likely is it that you would recommend Material-UI to a friend or colleague?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/2a.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 0.20% - 1, 0% - 2, 0.20% - 3, 0.20% - 4, 1.02% - 5, 1.97% - 6, 8.71% - 7, 22.52% - 8, 20.88% - 9, 44.29% - 10" />
<br />
<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/2b.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Pie chart: 73.3% Very disappointed, 21.3% somewhat disappointed, 5.4% not disappointed." />

As previous year, we again calculated the [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter)
(promoters less detractors). This year it is again a pretty high number 61.54%! (As the values for the NPS range are between -100 and +100, a “positive” score or NPS is considered “good”, +50 is “Excellent”, and above 70 is considered “world class”).

### 3. Who do you think would most benefit from Material-UI?

This word cloud was generated with [wordclouds.com](https://wordclouds.com).

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/3.jpg" style="width: 550px;" alt="Word cloud of who would benefit most" />

Developers are again in the center of our universe :) (And "people" and "teams" in general, of course!) This is understandable, given the [job role demographic](#8-which-of-the-following-best-describes-your-current-job-role)
of the majority of respondents. We will push hard on making the experience for you even better over the next year.

### 4. What is the main benefit you receive from Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/4.jpg" style="width: 550px;" alt="Word cloud of the main benefit of Material-UI" />

These responses on this question are very clear indicator to us about what we need to continue to do more. Some of the most repetating points were the palette of components, the ease of use, the documentation, as well as the design. We will for sure continue to work on all of these.

### 5. How can we improve Material-UI for you?

As the answers to this questions were pretty different, we grouped them into different categories and counted the different number of times the concern was mention. You can see all of them sorted by descending order, where the most important concerns are listed first:

### 6. What are your key criteria when choosing a UI library?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/6.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 21.99% The design, look & feel, 21.64% Documentation quality, 16.38% Customizability, 8.42% TypeScript integration, 6.89% Comprehensiveness, 5.35% Enterprise ready, 4.68% Bundle size, 4.92% Popularity, 4.45% Accessibility, 2.62% Documentation quality, 1.88% Offered support & help, 0.12% Performance, 0.67% Other." />

## About you

### 7. How did you hear about Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/7.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 50.65%	Search, 26.18%	Word of mouth, 10.76%	Social, 5.10%	Blog, 7.31%	Other." />

### 8. Which of the following best describes your current job role?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/8.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 52.18%	Full-stack developer, 27.11%	Frontend developer, 11.65%	Entrepreneur (I do it all), 3.47%	Beginner learning web development, 1.23%	Backend Developer, 1.16%	UX Designer, 0.34%	Student, 0.20%	CTO, 2.66%	Other." />

This was expected :) 

### 9. How big is your organization?

<img  src="/static/blog/2020-survey/9.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 12.30%	Hobby / side project, 13.40%	Self-employed, 35.60%	2-5 people, 16.10%	6-10, 10.30%	11-20, 5.10%	21-50, 2.50%	51-100, 4.60%	100+" />

Seems like we are continiosly most popular with small to medium sized organisations, so we will keep working on the ease of use of the components, while at the same time, allowing designers to give the appearence of their organization into each one of them.

### 10. How long have you been developing with JavaScript

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/10.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 3.60%	I'm just getting started!, 7.40%	6 months +, 20.80%	1 year +, 27.80%	3 years +, 24.30%	5 years +, 9.80%	10 years +, 4.10%	15 years +, 2.30%	20 years +" />

We can see the normal distrubution of the developers experience here, where most of them have a "mid" level of experience (between 1 and 5 years).

### 11. How long have you been developing with React?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/11.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 10.70%	I'm just getting started!, 15.60%	6 months +, 24.60%	1 year +, 21.40%	2 years +, 23.10%	3 years +, 4.60%	Bleeding edge baby! 5 years +" />

### 12. How long have you been developing with Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/12.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 20.50%	I'm just getting started!, 24.90%	6 months +, 28%	1 year +, 17.40%	2 years +, 7.50%	3 years +, 1.70%	I'm a pioneer! 4 years +" />

### 13. What were you primarily using before Material-UI?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/13.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 47.08%	Bootstrap, 16.04%	Custom system, 13.68%	Started with Material-UI, 6.67%	Angular Material, 4.44%	Semantic-UI, 3.19%	Ant Design, 8.89%	Other" />

Similar to last year, it seems that still most of the responders were previously using Bootstrap. We can see that also the custom solutions were replaced with Material-UI as well as some other frameworks.

### 14. How many Material-UI based projects have you built?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/14.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 11.50%	0 (I’m just getting started), 23%	1, 54.80%	2-5, 7.80%	6-10, 2.90%	10+" />

## Your product

### 15. What are you building?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/15.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 23.43%	Enterprise application, 20.31%	Dashboard admin app, 7.40%	A design system, 7.40%	A set of UI components, 7.37%	playing with tech, 7.34%	A prototype, 6.40%	Landing page, 5.41%	e-commerce site, 4.80%	CMS, 3.59%	Portfolio or resume, 1.88%	Blog, 4.69%	Other" />

Enterprises and dashboards are at the top of the heap, and yes, we know that for many of you, the system you are building are internal, but if some of you have an system that you would like to share as part of [the showcase](/discover-more/showcase/), let us know by opening a PR. Also for those of you building UI components, we'd be happy to give you a shout out in the [related projects](/discover-more/related-projects/)
section.

### 16. What “delivery mechanism” are you using?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/16.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 68.37%	Single page app (Create React App, etc), 18.24%	Server-side rendered website (Next.js, Gatsby, etc), 6.22%	Desktop app (Electron, etc), 4.65%	Native mobile app (Cordova, etc), 0.10%	React Native, 2.40%	Other" />

### 17. Who are you building it for?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/17.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Pie chart: 55.17%	For my company
22.86%	For a client, 16.94%	Side project, 5.03%	More than one of these." />

### 18. Which JS framework are you using, if any?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/18.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Pie chart: 57.34%	Create React App, 16.40%	Custom webpack, 12.35%	Next.js, 5.40%	Gatsby, 8.51%	Other." />

### 19. What styling system are you using?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/19.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Pie chart: 53.84%	Material-UI styles (JSS), 20.41%	Styled components, 13.01%	Good plain CSS, 8.31%	CSS Modules, 1.96%	Emotion, 0.59%	scss, 0.59%	sass, 0.09%	less, 1.19%	Other" />

The trends seems to be similar to the one from the last year's survey, so we will push with better support for styled components.

### 20. Has your organization ever paid for UI components??

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/20.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Pie chart: 89.90%	No, 10.10% Yes" />

### 21. What type system are you using?

<img src="/static/blog/2020-survey/21.png" style="width: 550px;" alt="Bar chart: 54.08%	None
30.87%	TypeScript 3.8, 7.31%	TypeScript 3.7, 1.90%	Flow, 1.55%	TypeScript 3.6, 0.98%	TypeScript 3.5, 3.31%	Other" />

## Conclusion

This data is **incredibly valuable** for our team.
Thank you again for participating!
We want to work on the problems that resonate the most with our users.
[It's clear](#4-how-can-we-improve-material-ui-for-you) that we should:

1. Support more components
2. Improve the customization
3. Improve the documentation
4. Improve the static typings
5. Reduce the overhead of the library

**We will update [our ROADMAP](/discover-more/roadmap/) in the coming days**.
We will run a similar survey next year to keep track of our progress.
