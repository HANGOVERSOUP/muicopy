We are excited to share that [Matheus Wichman](https://github.com/m4theushw) has joined Material-UI.
He has started a couple of days ago full-time and is now part of the advanced components team.

Before joining Material-UI, Matheus worked as a software engineer at a consulting agency in Brazil.
He has spent the last three years focusing on React and the frontend world.
His last project was for a financial institution.
Matheus is passionate about software development, so much that he started his career very early on.

I was impressed by his capability to quickly jump into an unknown codebase and reverse entropy.
In a couple of days, he has managed to report and fix bugs, both in the design system repository (_mui-org/material-ui_) and in the advanced components repository (_mui-org/material-ui-x_).

While I can't predict the future, Matheus will initially help us deliver the planned breaking changes of Material-UI v5, increase the pace of the date range picker, and push the data grid forward.

Matheus is the first of a series of 5 new positions we have recently opened and almost all filled.
We will cross the 10 people milestone in the coming weeks.
We have open these positions to keep up with the growth of our revenues.
At the current pace (+4%/week), we will soon open new positions.
You can [follow us](https://twitter.com/MaterialUI) on Twitter to be notified of the upcoming positions.
These new roles will help accelerate our mission, strengthen our existing offering, and initiate a new vertical.

We couldnâ€™t be more excited to have him on the team!
