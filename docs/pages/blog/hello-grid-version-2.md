We have shipped the new `Grid` component in [Material UI v5.9.0](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases/tag/v5.9.0) that will replace the existing one in the next major release.

```js
import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid'; // The current grid, a.k.a. Grid v1
import Grid2 from '@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2'; // The new grid, a.k.a. Grid v2
```

## The problems and motivation

- To fix the migration pain points ([#26266](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/29266) and [#31244](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/31244)) for the grid component which is caused by the [implementation changes](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/24332) introduced in v5.
- It is an opportunity to add the long-awaited [offset feature](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/11251) to the grid component.
- The grid container is using child combinator (`>`) to style the grid items which makes [customization](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/28855) harder.
- The [limitation](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/#nested-grid) on nested grids could be fixed.
- Unnecessary `item` prop.

## What's new

The `Grid v2` has been rewritten from scratch with CSS variables and `calc()` which lets us fix the issues and apply new features easily.

### üí• Breaking change

The negative margin in `Grid v2` spreads equally on all sides by default (same as the `Grid` in Material UI v4).

:::info
We believe that the migration from Grid `v1` to `v2` will be smooth for most of the cases.

### üöÄ New features

#### [Preventing scrollbar](/material-ui/react-grid2/#disable-the-scrollbar)

A new prop called `disableEqualOverflow` is added to properly prevent the scrollbar issue in small viewports.

#### [Offset](/material-ui/react-grid2/#offset)

We have added the long-awaited offset feature to `Grid v2`. Thanks to CSS variables, it lets us implement the feature with just a few lines of code.

### ‚ú® Improvements

#### Simplifying logic

Some parts of the calculation are delegated to CSS by using CSS variables and `calc()` together. They reduces the need of javascript and makes the component scalable.

For example, the `Grid v1` currently calculates the width by reading the value from a React context. However, with CSS variables in place, we can remove the React context and hand over the work to CSS instead:

```js
{
  // --Grid-columns is defined in the grid container
  width: `calc(100% * ${value} / var(--Grid-columns))`,
}
```

Another example is how the padding is calculated in grid items:

In `Grid v1`, grid items has no information about the padding it should have because the `spacing` prop is defined on the grid container. So, the simplest way is to control the padding from the grid container using CSS child combinator (`>`):

```js
function getOffset(val) {
  const parse = parseFloat(val);
  return `${parse}${String(val).replace(String(parse), '') || 'px'}`;
}
// ...The code is shorten for readability
({
  [`& > .${gridClasses.item}`]: {
    // Grid item's padding is controlled by its container
    paddingTop: getOffset(themeSpacing),
  },
});
```

However, in `Grid v2`, the javascript logic can be separated independently because CSS variables shift the communication between container and item to CSS.

- **Grid container** takes care of the variables generation based on the `spacing` prop:
  ```js
  // The code is simplified for readability
  {
    '--Grid-rowSpacing': spacingProp,
    '--Grid-columnSpacing': spacingProp,
  }
  ```
- **Grid item** refers to the variables:
  ```js
  {
    padding: `calc(var(--Grid-rowSpacing) / 2) calc(var(--Grid-columnSpacing) / 2)`,
  }
  ```

This is a very good use case for applying CSS variables when it comes to components that has a parent-child relationship which also support media query customization.

#### Remove unnecessary props

In version 2, `Grid` is always an item which is similar to the flexbox item in CSS, so the `item` prop is not needed anymore.

We also update the grid styles to work with ellipsis text by default, so the `zeroMinWidth` prop is removed.

```diff
 <Grid container spacing={2}>
-  <Grid item zeroMinWidth><Typography>Long text...</Typography></Grid>
+  <Grid><Typography>Long text...</Typography></Grid>
 </Grid>
```

#### Nested grid

With CSS variables and the removal of the `item` prop, there is no more limitation for creating nested grids.

As a bonus, a grid container automatically inherits row and column spacing values from the root grid container unless they are specified directly on the component.

```js
import Grid from '@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2`;

// root grid container
<Grid container spacing={2}>
  <Grid>...</Grid>
  <Grid container> {/* inherits spacing from the root container */}
    <Grid>...</Grid>
    <Grid>...</Grid>
  </Grid>
  <Grid>...</Grid>
</Grid>
```

## Future plan and migration

Since the `Grid v2` is rewritten from scratch, it is currently considered Unstable\_ as we give the community time to try it out and offer feedback. We will make it stable and deprecate v1 in the next major release of Material UI.
