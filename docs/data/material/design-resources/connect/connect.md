# Connect plugin

<p class="description">Connect is a Figma plugin that generates Material UI themes directly from design to code.</p>

## Introduction

[Connect](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1336346114713490235/) is a Figma plugin that lets you generate a theme from the [Material UI for Figma Design Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/912837788133317724/material-ui-for-figma-and-mui-x/).
You can customize design tokens and components, export the generated theme as a JSON file, and visualize your customizations through an embedded Storybook instance.

:::info
This plugin is in beta.
Component customization support is currently limited to the Button, Switch, and Typography components.
More components will follow soon!
:::

:::warning
Connect works in combination with the Material UI for Figma Design Kit [v5.16.0 and later](https://github.com/mui/mui-design-kits/releases).
Other kits, such as the Joy UI Design Kit, are not supported yet.

## Running the plugin

If you don't have [the complete and latest](/store/items/figma-react/) Material UI Design Kit version installed, you can test the plugin by using [the Community version](https://www.figma.com/community/file/912837788133317724/material-ui-for-figma-and-mui-x/) instead.

After installing it, open the Design Kit file on Figma.
Then head over to [the Connect profile page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1336346114713490235/) on Figma's Community tab and click on **Open in...**
Select the Design Kit file.

## Customizing design tokens

Design tokens consist of the styles that are defined through Figma's [local variables](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15145852043927-Create-and-manage-variables) and [local styles](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039820134-Manage-and-share-styles#:~:text=Local%20styles%20are%20styles%20that,or%20from%20the%20style%20picker.).

### Existing tokens

The Material UI Design Kit comes fully loaded with design tokens that map out to [the default theme of the Material UI React library](/material-ui/customization/default-theme/).
Connect can read all of the existing tokens in the theme.

To customize tokens using local variables, open the modal by clicking on the filter icon as shown below.
Tweak any of the variables available there as you see fit.

Then open the plugin and click on **Generate theme**.
The theme will then be updated in the code editor with your customizations.

### Adding new tokens

You can add custom tokens such as new colors or shadows to the existing list.
After adding them, click on **Regenerate theme** again to see them in the code editor tab.

## Customizing the components

You can customize how a component looks in all of its variants and states and generate its theme using Connect.

<video controls muted loop width="1584" height="1080" style="border-radius: 12px; border: 1px solid; border-color: hsla(0, 0%, 0%, .1);">
  <source src="/static/material-ui/design-resources/custom-component.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Using the generated theme

The code generated by Connect uses [the `CssVarsProvider` API](/material-ui/experimental-api/css-theme-variables/migration/) under the hood.
This primarily impacts you if your project supports both light and dark modes, whereas component customization code should work on your theme regardless of which API you're using because Connect utilizes CSS classes to target component slots.

### Theme tokens

For example, if you've changed the primary main color in light mode as well as the border-radius value, you would add the code to your theme as shown below:

```js
const theme = extendTheme({
  colorSchemes: {
    light: {
      palette: {
        primary: {
          main: '#BBDEFB', // example color
        },
      },
    },
  },
  shape: {
    borderRadius: 12,
  },
});
```

:::info
The `colorSchemes` node and `extendTheme` function are the only elements particular to the `CssVarsProvider` API.
Remove the former and change the latter to `createTheme` if you're using [the standard `ThemeProvider` API](/material-ui/customization/theming/) instead.
:::

## Component customizations

The code Connect generates for component customizations can be copied and pasted into your theme's `component` node.
For example, if you've customized the Switch's track and thumb size, you would add the code to your theme as shown below:

```js
const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiSwitch: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          '&.MuiSwitch-sizeMedium:has(.MuiSwitch-colorPrimary)': {
            '&:has(.Mui-checked):not(:has(.Mui-disabled)):not(:has(.Mui-focusVisible))':
              {
                '& .MuiSwitch-switchBase': {
                  transform: 'translateX(20px) translateY(5px)',
                  '& .MuiSwitch-thumb': {
                    width: '15px',
                    height: '15px',
                    boxShadow: 'none',
                  },
                  '& + .MuiSwitch-track': {
                    height: '20px',
                  },
                },
              },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can safely remove the `has()` pseudo-classes unless you know you have a specific need for them—they're used by the Connect plugin to isolate changes made in Figma.

Here's what the snippet above would look like in that case:

```js
const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiSwitch: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          '&.MuiSwitch-sizeMedium.MuiSwitch-colorPrimary': {
            '& .MuiSwitch-switchBase': {
              transform: 'translateX(20px) translateY(5px)',
              '& .MuiSwitch-thumb': {
                width: '15px',
                height: '15px',
                boxShadow: 'none',
              },
              '& + .MuiSwitch-track': {
                height: '20px',
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```
