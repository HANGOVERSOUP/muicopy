<p class="description">A carefully curated list of complementary to Material UI libraries that are worth having a look at.</p>

Since Material UI is an open-ended UI library, we do our best to ensure that it works well with other libraries and tools.
Feel free to submit a pull request to add another project; it will be accepted if it is suitable.
