# Date / Time pickers

<p class="description">The `<DatePicker>`, `<TimePicker>`, and related components have been moved to MUI Xâ€”our collection of advanced components.</p>

## Why have the picker components been moved to MUI X?

MUI X components are built for complex use cases. Date and time pickers are difficult to pull off correctly, so they deserve the special attention that they will receive as part of MUI X. To learn more, check out the [blog post about the move](/blog/lab-pickers-to-mui-x/).

## How do I migrate?

Follow the [migration page](/x/react-date-pickers/migration/) to migrate from lab to MUI X.

## Where is the new documentation?

You can find Date / Time pickers' documentation in the [MUI X docs](/x/react-date-pickers/).

## How to report issues, request a feature, or submit a PR?

You should go to the [MUI X repository](https://github.com/mui/mui-x) to do those things now that the Pickers have been moved there.
