# Box

<p class="description">The Box component is a generic, theme-aware container with access to CSS utilities from MUI System.</p>

## Introduction

The Box component is a part of the standalone [MUI System](/system/getting-started/) utility library.
It is re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience.

Please refer to the [Box](/system/react-box/) component page in the MUI System docs for more demos and details on usage.

## Basics

The Box component renders as a `<div>` by default, but you can swap in any other valid HTML tag or React component using the `component` prop.

The demo below replaces the `<div>` with a `<Box>` element:
