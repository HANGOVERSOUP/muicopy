# Click-Away Listener

<p class="description">The Click-Away Listener component detects when a click event happens outside of its child element.</p>

## Migrate to MUI Base

:::warning
Click-Away Listener is now part of the standalone [MUI Base](/base/getting-started/overview/) component library.
It is currently re-exported in `@mui/material` for convenience, but it may be deprecated from this package in a future major version of Material UI.

To continue using this component and avoid future breaking changes, we strongly recommend that you [install MUI Base](/base/getting-started/installation/) and import this component from the `@mui/base` package:


```js
import ClickAwayListener from '@mui/base/ClickAwayListener';
```

Please refer to the [Click-Away Listener](/base/react-clickaway-listener/) page in the MUI Base docs for examples and details on usage.
