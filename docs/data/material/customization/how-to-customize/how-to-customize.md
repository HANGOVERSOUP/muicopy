# How to customize

<p class="description">Learn the many options for customizing the Material UI components.</p>

There are a few approaches you could choose for cusotmizing a given component styles. It will ultimately depend on your specific context to decide which is the most appropriate one. Let's go through them from the narrowest use case to the broadest:

1. [One-off customization](#1-one-off-customization)
1. [Reusable style overrides](#2-reusable-style-overrides)
1. [Global theme variation](#4-global-theme-variation)
1. [Global CSS override](#5-global-css-override)

## 1. One-off customization

If you want to change the styles of a component in a specific location and don't want it to be perpetuated to other instances of it, you have the following solutions available:

### Use the `sx` prop

The easiest way to add style overrides for a one-off situation is to use the [`sx` prop](/system/basics/#the-sx-prop), which is available on all Material UI components.
Here is an example:

{{"demo": "SxProp.js" }}

#### Overriding nested component styles

If you want to customize very specific parts of a component, you can use classes provided by Material UI inside the `sx` prop. As an example, let's say you want to change the Slider's thumb from a circle to a square.

First step would be using the browser dev tools to identify the class for the component slot you want to override:

<img src="/static/images/customization/dev-tools.png" alt="dev-tools" width="796" style="margin-bottom: 16px;" />

Then, copy the target class of `MuiSlider-thumb`, place it inside the styles witihn the `sx` prop, and add your overrides.

{{"demo": "DevTools.js"}}

The styles injected into the DOM by Material UI rely on class names that [follow a simple pattern](/styles/advanced/#class-names):
`[hash]-Mui[Component name]-[name of the slot]`.

In this case, the styles are applied with `.css-ae2u5c-MuiSlider-thumb` but you only really need to target the `.MuiSlider-thumb`, where `Slider` is the component and `thumb` is the slot.

> ⚠️ Note that these class names can't be used as CSS selectors because they are unstable.

### Overriding styles with class names

If you want to override the component styles using custom classes, you can use the `className` prop, available on each component. Use the same approach described above if you want to override specific parts of the component.

Go to the [Styles Library Interoperability](/guides/interoperability/) guide to find examples of this approach using different styling libraries.

### State classes

States like _hover_, _focus_, _disabled_ and _selected_, are styled with a higher CSS specificity. To customize them, you'll need to **increase specificity**. Here is an example with the _disable_ state and the Button component using a pseudo-class (`:disabled`):

```css
.Button {
  color: black;
}

/* Increase the specificity */
.Button:disabled {
  color: white;
}
```

```jsx
<Button disabled className="Button">
```

Sometimes though, you won't be able to use a CSS pseudo-class, as the state doesn't exist in the web specification.
Let's take the `MenuItem` component and its _selected_ state as an example.
In such cases you can use a Material UI equivalent of CSS pseudo-classes—**state classes**.
Target the `.Mui-selected` global class name to customize the special state of the `MenuItem` component:

```css
.MenuItem {
  color: black;
}

/* Increase the specificity */
.MenuItem.Mui-selected {
  color: blue;
}
```

```jsx
<MenuItem selected className="MenuItem">
```

If you'd like to learn more about CSS specificity, we recommend checking [MDN's guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) about it.

#### Why do I need to increase specificity to override one component state?

By design, the CSS specification makes the pseudo-classes increase the specificity.
For consistency with native elements, Material UI increases the specificity of its custom state classes.
This has one important advantage: it allows you to cherry-pick the state you want to customize.

#### What custom state classes are available in Material UI?

You can rely on the following [global class names](/styles/advanced/#with-material-ui-core) generated by Material UI:

| State         | Global class name   |
| :------------ | :------------------ |
| active        | `.Mui-active`       |
| checked       | `.Mui-checked`      |
| completed     | `.Mui-completed`    |
| disabled      | `.Mui-disabled`     |
| error         | `.Mui-error`        |
| expanded      | `.Mui-expanded`     |
| focus visible | `.Mui-focusVisible` |
| focused       | `.Mui-focused`      |
| required      | `.Mui-required`     |
| selected      | `.Mui-selected`     |

> ⚠️ Never style these state classes' names directly. If you do that, it will impact all the components with unclear side-effects. Always target it together with a component.

```css
/* ❌ NOT OK */
.Mui-error {
  color: red;
}

/* ✅ OK */
.MuiOutlinedInput-root.Mui-error {
  color: red;
}
```

## 2. Reusable style overrides

If you find that you need to reuse the same overrides in different locations across your application, you can use the [`styled()`](/system/styled/) utility to create a reusable component:

{{"demo": "StyledCustomization.js", "defaultCodeOpen": true}}

### Dynamic overrides

Using the `styled()` utility above allows you to add dynamic styles based on the component's props. Here are two ways you can do that:

#### Dynamic CSS

> ⚠️ Note that if you are using TypeScript you will need to update the prop's types of the new component.

{{"demo": "DynamicCSS.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';
import Slider, { SliderProps } from '@mui/material/Slider';

interface StyledSliderProps extends SliderProps {
  success?: boolean;
}

const StyledSlider = styled(Slider, {
  shouldForwardProp: (prop) => prop !== 'success',
})<StyledSliderProps>(({ success, theme }) => ({
  ...(success &&
    {
      // the overrides added when the new prop is used
    }),
}));
```

#### CSS variables

{{"demo": "DynamicCSSVariables.js"}}

## 3. Global theme overrides

If you want to secure styling consistency between components, managing your user interface as a whole, Material UI provides a way to customize the components from the theme level. We have a dedicated guide about this approach, take a look at the [Component theming customization](/customization/theme-components/) page for more details.

## 4. Global CSS override

If you just want to add some global baseline styles for some of the HTML elements, you can use the `GlobalStyles` component. Here is an example of how you can override styles for the `h1` elements.

{{"demo": "GlobalCssOverride.js", "iframe": true, "height": 100}}

If you are already using the [CssBaseline](/components/css-baseline/) component for setting baseline styles, you can also add these global styles as overrides for this component. Here is how you can achieve the same by using this approach.

{{"demo": "OverrideCssBaseline.js", "iframe": true, "height": 100}}

> Note: It is a good practice to hoist the `<GlobalStyles />` to a static constant, to avoid rerendering. This will ensure that the `<style>` tag generated would not recalculate on each render.

```diff
 import * as React from 'react';
 import GlobalStyles from '@mui/material/GlobalStyles';

+const inputGlobalStyles = <GlobalStyles styles={...} />;

 const Input = (props) => {
   return (
     <React.Fragment>
-      <GlobalStyles styles={...} />
+      {inputGlobalStyles}
       <input {...props} />
     </React.Fragment>
   )
 }
```
