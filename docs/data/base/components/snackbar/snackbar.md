# Unstyled snackbar

<p class="description">The <code>SnackbarUnstyled</code> component provides brief notifications.</p>

```js
import SnackbarUnstyled from '@mui/base/SnackbarUnstyled';
```

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Basic usage

{{"demo": "UnstyledSnackbar.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Transitions

You can animate the open and close states of the snackbar with a render prop child and a transition component as shown below, as long as the component meets these conditions:

- Is a direct child descendent of the snackbar
- Has an `in` propâ€”this corresponds to the open state
- Passes the `exited` prop to `SnackbarUnstyled`
- Calls the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts - sets `exited` to false
- Calls the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed - sets `exited` to true

These two callbacks allow the snackbar to unmount the child content when closed and keep it fully transitioned. This is only applicable if you are using transition components using [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) library internally.

## The useSnackbar hook

```js
import { useSnackbar } from '@mui/base/SnackbarUnstyled';
```

The `useSnackbar` hook lets you use the functionality of `SnackbarUnstyled` in other components.

It returns props to be placed on the root element. If you are using `ClickAwayListener` to close the snackbar by clicking outside of it, make sure to pass `onClickAway` handler returned by this hook to the `ClickAwayListener` component.

Make sure to pass the `open` state to the hook and use it to show/hide the snackbar.
