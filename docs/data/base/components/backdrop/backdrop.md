# Unstyled backdrop

<p class="description">The backdrop component is used to provide emphasis on a particular element or parts of it.</p>

```js
import BackdropUnstyled from '@mui/base/BackdropUnstyled';
```

The backdrop signals to the user of a state change within the application and can be used for creating loaders, dialogs, and more.
In its simplest form, the backdrop component will add a dimmed layer over your application.
