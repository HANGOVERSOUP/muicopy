# Click-away listener

<p class="description">The <code>ClickAwayListener</code> component detects when a click event happens outside of its children elements.</p>

- üì¶ [981 B gzipped](/size-snapshot)
- ‚öõÔ∏è Supports portals

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Basic usage

The following demo shows how to hide a menu dropdown when users click anywhere else on the page:

{{"demo": "ClickAway.js"}}

> **Note:** the `ClickAwayListener` component only accepts _one_ child element.

You can find a more advanced demo on the [Menu documentation section](/components/menus/#menulist-composition).

## Portal

The following demo uses the [`Portal`](/base/react-portal/) component to render the dropdown into a new subtree outside of the current DOM hierarchy:

{{"demo": "PortalClickAway.js"}}

## Leading edge

By default, the `ClickAwayListener` component responds to **trailing events**‚Äîthe _end_ of a click or touch.

You can set the component to listen for **leading events** (the start of a click or touch) using the `mouseEvent` and `touchEvent` props, as shown in the following demo:

{{"demo": "LeadingClickAway.js"}}

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** When the component is set to listen for leading events, interactions with the scrollbar are ignored.

## Accessibility

By default, `ClickAwayListener` will add an `onClick` handler to its children.
This can result in screen readers announcing that the children are clickable, even though this `onClick` handler has no effect on the children elements themselves.

To prevent this behavior, add `role="presentation"` to the immediate children:

```tsx
<ClickAwayListener>
  <div role="presentation">
    <h1>non-interactive heading</h1>
  </div>
</ClickAwayListener>
```

This is also required to fix a known issue in NVDA when using Firefox that prevents the announcement of alert messages‚Äîsee [mui/material-ui#29080](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/29080) for details.
