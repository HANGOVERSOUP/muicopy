# MUI Base - Overview

<p class="description">MUI Base is a library of blank ("unstyled") React UI components and low-level hooks.</p>

## Introduction

MUI Base is library of unstyled React UI components.
It features the same robust engineering as Material UI, but without implementing Material Design.

MUI Base includes prebuilt components with production-ready functionality, along with low-level hooks for transferring that functionality to other components.

With MUI Base, you can rapidly build on top of our foundational components using any styling solution you choose—no need to override any default style engines or settings.

## Advantages of MUI Base

- **Ship faster:** MUI Base gives you the foundational building blocks you need to assemble a sleek and sophisticated user interface in a fraction of the time that it would take to do it all from scratch.

- **You own the CSS:** unlike Material UI, which uses Emotion as a default style engine, MUI Base has no built-in styling solution.
  This means you have complete control over how to implement styles in your app.

- **Accessibility:** MUI Base components are built with accessibility in mind.
  We do our best to make all components screen reader-friendly, and offer suggestions for optimizing accessibility throughout our documentation.

### MUI Base vs. Material UI

MUI Base features many of the same components as Material UI, but _without the Material Design implementation_.

You could think of MUI Base as the "skeletal" version of Material UI—foundational components with no default theme or built-in style engine.

This makes Base a great choice if you need complete control over how your app's CSS is implemented.
