# Box

<p class="description">The Box component serves as a wrapper component for most of the CSS utility needs.</p>

## Introduction

The Box component is a generic component that offers all the style functions exposed in [`@mui/system`](/system/getting-started/).

Demo here

## Basics

```jsx
import Box from '@mui/joy/Box';
```

The Box differs slightly from other Joy UI components as it doesn't support the props you'd expect such as `variant`, `color`, and `size`.

That's because it's a component based on the MUI System, a collection of CSS utilities for rapidly laying out custom designs.

## Customization

### The sx prop

The sx prop lets you work with a superset of CSS that packages all of the style functions exposed in `@mui/system`.
You can specify any valid CSS using this prop, as well as many theme-aware properties that are unique to MUI System
