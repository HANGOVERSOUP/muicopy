# Modal

<p class="description">The modal component provides a solid foundation for creating dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, or whatever else.</p>

## Introduction

Joy UI provides five modal-related components:

- [`Modal`](#basic-usage): A container that renders its `children` node in front of a backdrop component.
- [`ModalClose`](#dialog): A button for closing the modal.
- [`ModalDialog`](#dialog): A component for rendering a modal dialog.
- [`ModalDialogTitle`](#dialog): A title for a modal dialog.
- [`ModalDialogDescription`](#dialog): A description for a modal dialog.

### Features

- ü•û Manages modal stacking when more than one is needed
- ü™ü Creates a backdrop to disable interaction with the rest of the app
- üîê Disables page scrolling while open
- ‚å®Ô∏è Manages focus correctly between the modal and its parent app
- ‚ôøÔ∏è Adds the appropriate ARIA roles automatically

:::info
The term "modal" is sometimes used interchangeably with "dialog," but this is incorrect.
A dialog may be _modal_ or _nonmodal (modeless)_.

A modal [blocks interaction with the rest of the application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window), forcing the user to take action.
As such, it should be used sparingly‚Äîonly when the app _requires_ user input before it can continue.
:::

## Component

### Basic usage

The `Modal` accepts a single React element as a child which can be a Joy UI component, e.g. [`Sheet`](/joy-ui/react-sheet/), or any custom element.

You can use the `ModalClose` component to render a close button that inherits the modal's `onClose` function.

{{"demo": "BasicModal.js"}}

:::info
The `ModalClose` accepts the variant prop because it uses the same styles as the [`IconButton`](/joy-ui/react-button/#icon-button).
:::

### Dialog

To create a modal dialog, place `ModalDialog` component inside the `Modal`.

The `ModalDialogTitle` and `ModalDialogDescription` give the modal dialog an accessible name and description respectively.

{{"demo": "BasicModalDialog.js"}}

#### Layout

The `ModalDialog`'s layout can be:

- `fullScreen`: the modal dialog covers the whole viewport.
- `center`: the modal dialog appears at the center of the viewport.

{{"demo": "LayoutModalDialog.js"}}

#### Variant

The `ModalDialog` supports the [global variants](/joy-ui/main-features/global-variants/) feature.

The `ModalClose`'s variant adapts automatically to have a proper contrast to the `ModalDialog`.

{{"demo": "VariantModalDialog.js"}}

#### Size

The `ModalDialog` comes with 3 sizes, `sm` `md` (default) and `lg`.

The `ModalClose` and `ModalDialogTitle` inherits the size from the `ModalDialog` unless the prop is specified directly to the components.

{{"demo": "SizeModalDialog.js"}}

### Alert Dialog

Use `role="alertdialog"` to create an [alert dialog](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alertdialog/) that interrupts the user's workflow.

{{"demo": "AlertDialogModal.js"}}

### Nested modals

The modal components can be nested:

{{"demo": "NestedModals.js"}}

:::warning
Though it is possible to create nested modals‚Äîfor example, a select modal within a dialog‚Äîstacking more than two at a time is discouraged.

This is because each successive modal blocks interaction with all elements behind it, making prior states inaccessible and overly complicated for the user to navigate through.
:::

### Transition

The modal components do not come with transition properties.

Here is one example using [`react-transition-group`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition) to create a fade animation:

{{"demo": "FadeModalDialog.js"}}

### Performance

The modal's content is unmounted when it is not open.
This means that it will need to be re-mounted each time it is opened.

If you are rendering expensive component trees inside your modal, and you want to optimize for interaction responsiveness, you can change this default behavior by enabling the `keepMounted` prop.

You can also use the `keepMounted` prop if you want to make the content of the modal available to search engines (even when the modal is closed).

The following demo shows how to apply this prop to keep the modal mounted:

{{"demo": "KeepMountedModal.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

As with any performance optimization, the `keepMounted` prop won't necessarily solve all of your problems.
Explore other possible bottlenecks in performance where you could make more considerable improvements before implementing this prop.

### Server-side modal

React [doesn't support](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13097) the [`createPortal()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) API on the server.

In order to display a modal rendered on the server, you need to disable the portal feature with the `disablePortal` prop, as shown in the following demo:

{{"demo": "ServerModal.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Limitations

### Focus trap

`ModalUnstyled` moves the focus back to the body of the component if the focus tries to escape it.

This is done for accessibility purposes, but it can potentially create issues for your users.

If the user needs to interact with another part of the page‚Äîfor example, to interact with a chatbot window while a modal is open in the parent app‚Äîyou can disable the default behavior with the `disableEnforceFocus` prop.

## Accessibility

See the [WAI-ARIA guide on the Dialog (Modal) pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/) for complete details on accessibility best practices.

- All interactive elements must have an [accessible name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby). Use the `aria-labelledby="id..."` to give your `Modal` component an accessible name.
  You can also use `aria-describedby="id..."` to provide a description of the `Modal`:

  ```jsx
  <Modal aria-labelledby="modal-title" aria-describedby="modal-description">
    <h2 id="modal-title">My Title</h2>
    <p id="modal-description">My Description</p>
  </Modal>
  ```

- Follow the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/dialog-modal/dialog.html) to help you set the initial focus on the most relevant element based on the content of the modal.
  :::warning
  A modal window can sit on top of either the parent application, or another modal window.
  _All_ windows under the topmost modal are **inert**, meaning the user cannot interact with them.
  This can lead to [conflicting behaviors](#focus-trap).
