# Drawer

<p class="description">Navigation drawers provide quick access to other destinations in your app without removing the user out of context.</p>

## Introduction

{{"demo": "DrawerUsage.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "gradient"}}

## Basic

The navigation drawers can toggle open or closed. Closed by default, the drawer opens temporarily above all other content until a section is selected.

The Drawer can be cancelled by clicking the overlay or pressing the Esc key.
It closes when an item is selected, handled by controlling the `open` prop.
