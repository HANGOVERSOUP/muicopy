# Introduction

<p class="description">Joy UI is a library of beautifully designed React UI components.</p>

Joy UI is a library of React UI components. It features foundational components such as the ones you'd find in Material UI.
It comes with a beautifully designed default theme so you can rapidly start your own design system.

You should see Joy UI as your starting point.
It includes a lot of customization features and the capability for you to match it to your desired look and feel.

:::warning
**Note:** as of Q2 2022, Joy UI is currently in active development, with an alpha version soon to be released.
We're adding new components and features regularly, and you're welcome to contribute! Look for the [`joy` label](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Ajoy) on open [issues](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pulls) in the `@mui/material-ui` repository on GitHub to see what other community members are working on, and feel free to submit your own.

## Advantages of Joy UI

- **Ship faster:** Joy UI gives you a significant amount of prebuilt components you need to develop web apps, with a sleek and carefully designed look and feel, allowing it to achieve a good-looking result without a dedicated designer.
- **Extensive customization:** you're encouraged to customize each and every tiny piece of the Joy UI components so they match your desired design.
- **Accessibility:** Joy UI components are built on top of MUI Base unstyled components and low-level hooks, giving you support for several accessibility features out of the box. We do our best to make all components screen reader-friendly, and offer suggestions for optimizing accessibility throughout our documentation.

## Joy UI vs. Material UI

Joy UI is meant to feature the same list of components you'd find in Material UI, with similar philosophy around component API and customization extensibility, but without the Material Design implementation.
If you ever wanted to use Material UI for the breadth of supported components, carefully written component API, and reliability of a tried and tested library but hesitated because of Material Design, Joy UI is here to solve that for you and act as the best alternative for that.
