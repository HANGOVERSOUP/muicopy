# Principles

<p class="description">The foundation, rules and guidance that shape this library.</p>

## Keep it essential

Developers should be able to make Joy works with the least amount of effort possible. A given component API, its design (look and feel), should strive to have only the essential, the standard, for what that component is meant to do. The definition of essentiality will be drawn by the experience MUI has gained through the years developing a component library as well as from benchmarks of modern API and design guidelines, given what's most suited for respecting the primary use-case (web-apps).

## Looks great **out-of-the-box**

The visual aspect of Joy is very important for its success. It has to be pleasant but simple, characteristic but not reinventing the wheel. Attributes such as scale, size, density should be consistent across the components so they live together nicely. We should seek to spark delight right from the first use of it. Developers should feel like they're starting looking sharp.
