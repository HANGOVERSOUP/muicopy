# Principles

<p class="description">The foundation, rules and guidance that shape this library.</p>

## Keep it essential

Developers should be able to make Joy works with the least amount of effort possible. A given component API, its design (look and feel), should strive to have only the essential, the standard, for what that component is meant to do. The definition of essentiality will be drawn by the experience MUI has gained through the years developing a component library as well as from benchmarks of modern API and design guidelines, given what's most suited for respecting the primary use-case (web-apps).

## Looks great **out-of-the-box**

The visual aspect of Joy is very important for its success. It has to be pleasant but simple, characteristic but not reinventing the wheel. Attributes such as scale, size, density should be consistent across the components so they live together nicely. We should seek to spark delight right from the first use of it. Developers should feel like they're starting looking sharp.

## Encourage creativity

Developers must be able to tweak Joy however they want so it becomes something of their own. We should strive for simple to understand and easy to apply customization features that enable rapidly extending the default look. This will make Joy desired by not only engineers who'll be operating it but also designers who'll be building on top of it, creating room for any design direction to be achieved out of it.

## Unopinionated

Joy does not have opinions on what the design should look like. Instead, Joy provides tools and guidelines for developers and designers to build robust UIs that fit in their context. One example feature that is led by this principle is the global variants.

## Values experience and productivity

Apart from high quality codes that we ship, we belive that the documentation and other learning resources play an important role to give the best experience to developers. We strive to build the documentation for everyone at any level of knowledge and continue to work with the community to create spark joy moment for them.
