# Roadmap

<p class="description">Learn how to track what's lined up for Joy UI's future.</p>

## Priorization method

Joy UI is a community-driven project, meaning we usually pick the issues and suggestions that resonate the most with the community.
Therefore, make sure to leave an upvote üëç on [the GitHub issues](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:%22package:+joy-ui%22) you are most interested in.

Additionally, the MUI team conducts yearly [developer surveys](/blog/?tags=Developer+survey/), which serves as a key input for Joy UI's roadmap, too.
Your participation is invaluable! Keep an eye on MUI's social media to enagege with the next one and help influence the future of this product!

## Keeping track of the roadmap

### Public GitHub project

We use a GitHub project to track initiative prioritization across all MUI Core products, including Joy UI.
The tasks we add to the project are usually those that we internally discussed having a strategic impact.

### Milestones

We also create milestones within the MUI Core repository, where Joy UI is developed, to keep track of larger cycles.
Check it out and follow which issues were picked up for the stable release and how overall progress is going.
