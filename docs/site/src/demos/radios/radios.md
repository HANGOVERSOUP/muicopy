# Radios

[Radio buttons](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/selection-controls.html#selection-controls-radio-button) allow the user to select one option from a set. Use radio buttons for exclusive selection if you think that the user needs to see all available options side-by-side.

## Complete Radio Group

The `<RadioGroup>` wrapper component is a complete form control.
This component is made up of the smaller `<Radio>` parts that you can also leverage yourself to significantly customize your input.
