# Lead Designer

<p class="description">We are looking for a lead designer to own most of our design work.</p>

## About Us

See the [careers](/company/careers/) and [about us](https://next.material-ui.com/branding/about/) pages.

## Details of the Role

- Type of work: Contractor (full-time, convertible to an employee position in the future).
- Start date: Immediately.
- Location: Remote (preference for UTC-5 to UTC+4).
- We're a remote company, we prefer asynchronous communication over meetings.
- We work independently, the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.

## Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community, and our premium products are [growing fast](https://www.similarweb.com/website/material-ui.com) (x2-3 YoY). We need talented people to keep that going!

We are looking for making high-end design skills accessible to the many, empowering developers that lack it. We need to make the library visually more appealing (starting with this very page), support a second theme, redo our branding, and a lot more.

We also need help to initiate our low-code effort.

## Why this is interesting

Material-UI empowers React developers to build awesome applications and websites. Hundreds of thousands of developers use Material-UI every month. Providing functional components isn't enough, far from it. In our [last developers' survey](https://material-ui.com/blog/2020-developer-survey-results/#6-what-are-your-key-criteria-when-choosing-a-ui-library), we have unveiled that the single most important factor for using a UI library is the design. We need to empower the developers to build beautiful UIs :D.

Our low-code effort is still brand new, and yet has the potential to scale the company to 1,000 people in the long term.

## What you'll do on a day-to-day basis

## Experience you should have

## Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn't required

## Compensation

The compensation for this position starts at \$100k/year for somebody with great design skills and goes up to $160k/year for somebody that has the ability to significantly push the project forward.
