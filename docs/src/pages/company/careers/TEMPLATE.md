## About the company

MUI started as Material-UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
It has gotten a massive following not only due to the fidelity to Material but also because of its number of components, carefully designed component API, obsession for details, and community engagement.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source projects to build their design system.

A few years back, we started expanding our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](/x/), a collection of advanced components, [MUI Design kits](/design-kits/), MUI components available in the most popular design tools out there, and [MUI Templates](/templates/), a set of pre-built UI.
We've seen fast growth in all of them (x2 ~ 3 year over year) and we have much more baking in the oven.

We are a team of fully distributed individuals, spread across multiple timezones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying on lots of documentation and written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.

## Why we're hiring
