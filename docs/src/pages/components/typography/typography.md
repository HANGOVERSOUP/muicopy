# Typography

<p class="description">Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.</p>

Too many type sizes and styles at once can spoil any layout.
A [typographic scale](https://material.io/design/typography/#type-scale) has a limited set of type sizes that work well together along with the layout grid.

## General

The _Roboto_ font will **not** be automatically loaded by Material-UI.
You are responsible for loading any fonts used in your application.
Roboto Font has a few easy ways to get started. For more advanced configuration, check out
[the theme customization section](/customization/typography/).

## Roboto Font CDN

Shown below is a sample link markup used to load the Roboto font from a CDN:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
/>
```

## Install with npm

You can [install it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fontsource-roboto) by typing the below command in your terminal:

`npm install fontsource-roboto`

Then, you can import it in your entry-point.

```js
import 'fontsource-roboto/300.css';
import 'fontsource-roboto/400.css';
import 'fontsource-roboto/500.css';
import 'fontsource-roboto/700.css';
```

For more info check out [Fontsource](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource).

Fontsource can be configured to load specific subsets, weights and styles.
Material-UI default typography configuration only relies on 300, 400, 500, and 700 font weights.

## Component

The Typography component makes it easy to apply a default set of font weights and sizes in your application.

## Theme

In some situations you might not be able to use the `Typography` component.
Hopefully, you might be able to take advantage of the [`typography`](/customization/default-theme/?expand-path=$.typography) keys of the theme.

## Changing the semantic element

The Typography component uses the `variantMapping` prop to associate a UI variant with a semantic element.
Itâ€™s important to realize that the style of a typography component is independent from the semantic underlying element.

- You can change the underlying element for a one-off situation with the `component` prop:

```jsx
{
  /* There is already an h1 in the page, let's not duplicate it. */
}
<Typography variant="h1" component="h2">
  h1. Heading
</Typography>;
```

- You can change the mapping [globally using the theme](/customization/globals/#default-props):

```js
const theme = createMuiTheme({
  components: {
    MuiTypography: {
      defaultProps: {
        variantMapping: {
          h1: 'h2',
          h2: 'h2',
          h3: 'h2',
          h4: 'h2',
          h5: 'h2',
          h6: 'h2',
          subtitle1: 'h2',
          subtitle2: 'h2',
          body1: 'span',
          body2: 'span',
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Adding & disabling variants

Apart from the default variants supported, you can add custom variants to use with the `Typography` component, or disable some existing ones. Here is what you need to do:

### Step 1. Update the theme's typography object

```js
const theme = createMuiTheme({
  typography: {
    poster: {
      color: 'red',
    },
    // Disable v3 variant
    h3: undefined,
  },
});
```

### Step 2. Update the necessary typings if you are using Typescript

**Note:** If you are not using `Typescript` you should skip this step.

You will need to make sure that the typings for the theme's `typography` variants and the `Typogrpahy`'s `variant` prop reflects the new set of variants.

```ts
declare module '@material-ui/core/styles/createTypography' {
  interface Typography {
    poster: React.CSSProperties;
  }

  // allow configuration using `createMuiTheme`
  interface TypographyOptions {
    poster?: React.CSSProperties;
  }
}

// Update the Typography's variant prop options
declare module '@material-ui/core/Typography/Typography' {
  interface TypographyPropsVariantOverrides {
    poster: true;
    h3: false;
  }
}
```

### Step 3. You can now use the new variant

```jsx
<Typography variant="poster">poster</Typography>;
{
  /* This variant is no longer supported! */
}
<Typography variant="h3">h3</Typography>;
```

## Accessibility

A few key factors to follow for an accessible typography:

- **Color**. Provide enough contrast between text and its background, check out the minimum recommended [WCAG 2.0 color contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) (4.5:1).
- **Font size**. Use [relative units (rem)](/customization/typography/#font-size) to accommodate the user's settings.
- **Heading hierarchy**. [Don't skip](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/) heading levels. In order to solve this problem, you need to [separate the semantics from the style](#changing-the-semantic-element).
