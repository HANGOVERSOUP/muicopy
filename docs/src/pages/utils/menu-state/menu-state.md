# MenuState

<p class="description">MenuState takes care of the boilerplate for common Menu use cases.</p>

It keeps track of the local state for a single `Menu` and passes props to inject into the
`Menu` and a trigger component (like a `Button`).

## Example

{{"demo": "pages/utils/menu-state/SimpleMenuState.js"}}
