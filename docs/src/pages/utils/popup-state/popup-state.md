# PopupState

<p class="description">PopupState takes care of the boilerplate for common Menu, Popover and Popper use cases.</p>

It keeps track of the local state for a single popup and passes props to inject into the
popup component and a trigger component (like a `Button`).

## Menu

## Popover

## Popper
