## Toggle Buttons

[Toggle buttons](https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons.html#buttons-toggle-buttons) may be used to group related options. Arrange layout and spacing to convey that certain toggle buttons are part of a group.

The `ToggleButtonGroup` will control the selected of its child buttons when
given its own `value` prop.
