## About the company

MUI started with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
It has gained a large following, not only due to the fidelity to Material Design, but also because of the number of components, its carefully designed component API, obsession for details, and community engagement.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source libraries to build their design system.

A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](https://mui.com/x/), a collection of advanced components; [MUI Design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/), the MUI components available for the most popular design tools; and also host [Templates](https://mui.com/templates/), a set of pre-built UI kits.
We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2-3x per year) and we have more to come.

We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple time zones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.
For additional details about the MUI team and culture, you can check our [careers](https://mui.com/careers/) and [about](/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2-3 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

We also need help to continue to improve the health of the open-source products: make the core components easier to use, engage more with the community, polish all the details, make the components more accessible, guiding developers to answers, and just generally be a positive presence in the open-source community.

### Why this is interesting

Our solution empowers React developers to build awesome applications faster â€“ we see over a million developers on MUI's docs every month.
Hundreds of thousands of developers use MUI every month.

This means that the impact of your work in improving the accessibility of our products would literally help millions of people who use the products built with our libraries.

## About the role

### What you'll do on a day-to-day basis

Depending on the day, you'll:

- **Ensure the components are accessible.**
  You would basically be an owner of the accessibility across all MUI products. It would be your responsibility to first verify the level of accessibility the components comply with and improve it over time.
- **Respond to issues related to accessibility.**
  Sometimes, users of our products create issues related to a11y, it would be your responsibility to answer them, by either providing best practices or fixing issues that they may have reported.
- **Intelligently apply accessibility testing tools, use assistive technology, and perform expert manual analysis of the MUI product lines.**
  Having a solid test framework that can help us make sure we stay compliant.
- **Lead the accessibility training across the company.**
  Basically, you would be the go-to person for anything related to accessibility, so mentoring others would be part of that deal.

## About you

### Skills you should have

- **A track record of accessibility experience with both consumer/enterprise products and assistive technologies, such as screen readers, eye-control, and other accessible technologies**.
  If you've been the accessibility champ in a previous company, pushing towards making sure the user interfaces can be used by disabled people, we want you in our team!
- **Hands-on knowledge of accessibility guidelines and standards (such as Section 508, WCAG, and EN 301 549) as well as technologies (such as UI Automation, IAccessible, ARIA, and related accessibility APIs)**
  You would be the one that the team can go to for any a11t topics/questions.
- **An advocate of continuous learning; able to absorb and share new ideas, approaches, and techniques for achieving accessibility.**
  Continuous learning is one of the most important parts of this field.
- **Strong grasp of accessibility techniques in web development applying HTML5, CSS, ARIA, and JavaScript.**
  We are creating products used on the WEB.
- **Experience with assistive technologies across multiple platforms, including screen readers, magnification, and read-aloud tools.**

### What would be nice if you had, but isn't required

- **Certification in accessibility, such as Trusted Tester, CPACC (Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies), WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist).**
  This would be a clear indication that you went deep into the accessibility topics.
- **You've contributed to a design system before**.
  You have worked on enterprise components in the past, maybe for internal use in your company.
  You have built some features while making sure the accessibility was fully functional.
