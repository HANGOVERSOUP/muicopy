# Customizing components

<p class="description">You can easily customize the appearance of a Material-UI component.</p>

As components can be used in different contexts, there are several approaches to this. Going from the narrowest use-case to the broadest, these are:

1. [One-time customization](#1-one-time-customization)
1. [Reusable style overrides](#2-reusable-style-overrides)
1. [Dynamic variation](#3-dynamic-variation)
1. [Global theme variation](#4-global-theme-variation)

## 1. One-time customization

You might need to change the style of a component for a specific implementation, for which you have the following solutions available:

### Use the `sx` prop

The easiest way to add style overrides for a one-time situation is to use the `sx` prop available on all Material-UI components. Here is an example of it:

{{"demo": "pages/customization/components/SxProp.js"}}

You may can see on the previous example, that you may use global class selectors for accessing slots inside the component, as well as theme callback for getting access to the theme.

Next you'll see how you can easily identify the classes which are available to you for each of the states and slots in the component.

### Overriding nested slots

You can use the browser dev tools to identify the slot you want to override. It can save you a lot of time.
The style injected in the DOM by Material-UI relies on class names that [follow a simple pattern](/styles/advanced/#class-names):
`[hash]-Mui[Component name]-[name of the slot]`.

⚠️ These class names can't be used as CSS selectors because unstable.
However, Material-UI applies global class names using a consistent convention: `Mui[Component name]-[name of the slot]`.

Let's go back to the above demo. How can you override the slider's thumb?

<img src="/static/images/customization/dev-tools.png" alt="dev-tools" width="406" />

In this example, the styles are applied with `.css-ae2u5c-MuiSlider-thumb` so the name of the component is `Slider` and the name of the slot is `thumb`.

Using the dev tools, now you know that you need to target the `.MuiSlider-thumb` class name for overriding the look of the thumb slot:

{{"demo": "pages/customization/components/DevTools.js"}}

### Overriding styles with class names

If you would like to override the styles of the components using classes, you can use the `className` prop available on each component. For overriding the styles of the slots inside the component, you may use the global classes available for each slot, as described in the previous section.

You may find different interoperability examples on the [Styles library interoperability](/guides/interoperability/) guide.

### Pseudo-classes

The components special states, like _hover_, _focus_, _disabled_ and _selected_, are styled with a higher CSS specificity.
[Specificity is a weight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) that is applied to a given CSS declaration.

In order to override the components special states, **you need to increase specificity**.
Here is an example with the _disable_ state and the button component using a **pseudo-class** (`:disabled`):

```css
.Slider {
  color: black;
}
/* Increase the specificity */
.Slider:disabled {
  color: white;
}
```

```jsx
<Slider disabled className="Slider">
```

Sometimes, you can't use a **pseudo-class** as the state doesn't exist in the platform.
Let's take the menu item component and the _selected_ state as an example.
You can use the `.Mui-selected` global class name to customize the special state of the `MenuItem` component:

```css
.MenuItem {
  color: black;
}
/* Increase the specificity */
.MenuItem.Mui-selected {
  color: blue;
}
```

```jsx
<MenuItem selected className="MenuItem">
```

#### Why do I need to increase specificity to override one component state?

By design, the CSS specification makes the pseudo-classes increase the specificity.
For consistency, Material-UI increases the specificity of its custom pseudo-classes.
This has one important advantage, it allows you to cherry-pick the state you want to customize.

#### What custom pseudo-classes are available in Material-UI?

You can rely on the following [global class names](/styles/advanced/#with-material-ui-core) generated by Material-UI:

| State        | Global class name |
| :----------- | :---------------- |
| checked      | Mui-checked       |
| disabled     | Mui-disabled      |
| error        | Mui-error         |
| focused      | Mui-focused       |
| focusVisible | Mui-focusVisible  |
| required     | Mui-required      |
| expanded     | Mui-expanded      |
| selected     | Mui-selected      |

## 2. Reusable style overrides

If you see yourself needing the same overrides on multiple places across your application, you can use the `experimentalStyled()` utility for creating a reusable component:

{{"demo": "pages/customization/components/StyledCustomization.js", "defaultCodeOpen": true}}

You have with it access to all components props to dynamically style the component.

## 3. Dynamic variation

You have learned how to override the style of a Material-UI component in the previous section.
Now, let's see how we can make these overrides dynamic.
Here are five alternatives; each has its pros and cons.

### Dynamic CSS

{{"demo": "pages/customization/components/DynamicCSS.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Class name branch

{{"demo": "pages/customization/components/DynamicClassName.js"}}

### CSS variables

{{"demo": "pages/customization/components/DynamicCSSVariables.js"}}

### Theme nesting

{{"demo": "pages/customization/components/DynamicThemeNesting.js"}}

## 4. Global theme variation

In order to promote consistency between components, and manage the user interface appearance as a whole, Material-UI provides a mechanism to apply global changes.

Please take a look on the [theme's global page](/customization/globals/) for more details.
