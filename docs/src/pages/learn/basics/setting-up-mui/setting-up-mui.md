# Setting up MUI

<p class="description">Setting up MUI is easy, just follow the steps bellow.</p>

## Installing MUI

Start by copying the installation command below to install the library in your project. You can choose npm or yarn, what's best for you.

```sh
// with npm
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

// with yarn
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## Adding the Roboto typeface

MUI contains Material Design by default which was designed with the Roboto font in mind. So, be sure to add it to your project. You can install it, for instance, via Google Web Fonts:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
/>
```

## Adding Font icons

To use the Font Icon component, used by a lot of the components, you must first add the Material Icons font. To do so, you can use again Google Web Fonts:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
/>
```
