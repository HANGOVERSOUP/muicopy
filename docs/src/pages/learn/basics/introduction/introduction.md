# Introduction

<p class="description">Here we begin our journey to building a great looking sign-in page with MUI.</p>

Before we dive in, let's see what using this library can bring to the application or website you are building.

## What's MUI?

MUI is a React UI component library that contains several foundational components for you to build any type of user interface you want. You can customize every component to its tiniest detail using advanced theming and styling features to match your specific needs. It comes with Material Design, Google's design system, out of the box to enable you to ship even faster.

## How's MUI different from other libraries?

Aside from having a big list (and always growing) of supported components, MUI offers several utility and styling tools that allow for efficient and modern UIs. It also has strong support for accessibility, which is constantly being improved so you can reach the largest audience possible. All of that makes for a library that will offer most of the things you need to build React UIs.

## Is it a safe library to use?

MUI is not only a library but also a company of +10 people (and hiring). It has a core team of maintainers and a +2k community of contributors frequently submitting issues, pull requests and making the project more stable and resilient. It's already on its fifth version that just came out containing a bunch of improvements and news. Multiple companies, including Fortune 500's, rely on MUI for their UIs.
