## Components and components API

If you go to the documentation, you'll see that the side nav is loaded with content. For now, let's focus on two folders which are probably the most important ones: Components and Components API.

The components are separated between their role in the interface, so we have Inputs, Data Display, Feedbacks, etc. To quickly search for what you want, you can hit `Cmd + K` if you're in a Mac or `Crtl + K` if you're in Windows. This will open the search dialog where you can type for any component.

Each component page displays variations and different configurations of the component. You'll see a live demo in all of them and the snippet code of it. This might give you an example of how the component can be used.

But, the first step of customization - which is in the next chapter - is understanding each component API. To do that, you can use the table of contents to quickly go to the component API page or to just use the search as mentioned. There you'll see every prop the component receives, its type, default values, and a brief description. It's key that you always check this in order to understand how they were designed and therefore supposed to work.

Scrolling down a bit, you'll find all the CSS global classes generated for each piece of the component. This is very important to customize the component down to the tiniest detail.
