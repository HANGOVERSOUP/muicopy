# Links

<p class="description">Links allow users to navigate around your webpage.</p>

## Links with icons

Sometimes you might want to have icons for certain links to enhance the UX of the application as we recognize logos more easily than plain text. For example, if you have a link to your homepage you can label it with a house icon.
