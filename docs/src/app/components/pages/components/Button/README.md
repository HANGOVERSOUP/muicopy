## Button
[Buttons](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html) communicate the action that will occur 
when the user touches them.

[Flat buttons](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-flat-buttons) are used for 
general functions and reduce the amount of layering on the screen, making it more readable.

[Raised buttons](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-raised-buttons) add dimension
to mostly flat layouts. They emphasize functions on busy or wide spaces.

A [Floating Action Button](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html)
represents the primary action in an application.
