## Installation

Material-UI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/material-ui).
After npm install, you will find all the `.jsx` files in the `/src` folder and
their compiled versions in the `/lib` folder.

### Roboto Font

Material-UI was designed with the [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)
font in mind.
So be sure to include it in your project.
Here are [some instructions](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto:400,300,500)
on how to do so.
